<body><h1>School of Open Course Review</h1><h2>School of Open Course Review Process</h2><p><i>How can my course join the School of Open?&nbsp;</i></p><p></p><ol><li>Check your course against the <a href='/School-of-Open-Guidelines'/>School of Open Guidelines</a>. Still interested?</li>
<li>Join the <a href='http://thepeople.p2pu.org/category/school-of-open'/>Discussion</a>. Post a draft of your course to the group and ask for feedback.</li>
<li>Iterate and improve.</li>
<li>Seek the final review of a School of Open organizer and make final changes.</li>
<li>Share a link to the published course with the group.</li></ol>

<p>We will add your course once it has undergone the review process. You can read the community&rsquo;s rationale behind the course review&nbsp; process below.</p><p></p><h2>School of Open Course Review Rationale</h2><p><i>This is the rationale behind the course review process as reached by the community.</i></p><p></p><p>The&nbsp; School of Open is foremost a community initiative, with courses being&nbsp; built by both individuals and organizations across the various “open”&nbsp; movements. No one organization claims responsibility or endorsement of&nbsp; all School of Open courses. The School aims to support existing&nbsp; education efforts within these “open” movements via the courses they&nbsp; create as part of the School of Open, and each course will be clearly&nbsp; identified with its creator.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to building and&nbsp; facilitating courses, collaborating organizations and individuals will&nbsp; collect feedback and improve their courses through community review&nbsp; (process outlined below). Moreover, all School of Open courses are&nbsp; licensed by default under CC BY-SA, the default P2PU platform license,&nbsp; so iterative improvements are encouraged and shared back with the&nbsp; community, in addition to being freely and legally available to all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In&nbsp; collaboration with the School of Open community, the following course&nbsp; review process has been outlined for the School. This process will be&nbsp; implemented in stages, and will remain flexible for future iteration as&nbsp; the community’s needs shift and grow.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Work-flow&nbsp; approval processes are already in place for all P2PU Schools; only the&nbsp; School’s organizer may designate a course as being part of that School.&nbsp; Furthermore, only the School’s organizer or P2PU administrator may make&nbsp; any changes to the design or layout of the School’s webpage. These&nbsp; technical measures prevent any course from being added to a School&nbsp; without the organizer’s approval. The School of Open’s organizers&nbsp; currently include staff from CC and P2PU, in addition to volunteers&nbsp; affiliated with the University of Michigan’s Open.Michigan initiative.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>1) Process</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In&nbsp; order for a course to be published as part of the School of Open, it&nbsp; must have undergone review and incorporated the feedback of two or more&nbsp; School of Open organizers. Since the School of Open is a joint&nbsp; initiative being coordinated by CC and P2PU, one organizer from each&nbsp; organization must review and provide feedback before the course can be&nbsp; added to the School of Open webpage. Furthermore, this review must take&nbsp; place openly and transparently (e.g. on a public mailing list or the&nbsp; course platform) so that the community may have ample opportunity to&nbsp; engage with course organizers and give feedback for improvement prior to&nbsp; a decision. Additional parties, such as content or domain experts, may&nbsp; be pulled into review a course on a case-by-case basis. This process&nbsp; does not apply to draft or in-development courses which are clearly&nbsp; noted as such on the School of Open page.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reviews will take&nbsp; place in the context of a set of evolving, community created guidelines&nbsp; for what is and is not a School of Open course at <a href="https://p2pu.hackpad.com/School-of-Open-Guidelines"></a><u>https://p2pu.hackpad.com/School-of-Open-Guidelines</u>. As the School of Open grows, these guidelines may morph into a set of&nbsp; published standards; as the project currently stands, the community&nbsp; agrees that the recommended guidelines are flexible enough to meet the&nbsp; needs of a course review process and to serve as initial guidance for&nbsp; new course creators seeking to join the School.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The community&nbsp; agrees that the course review process must remain flexible and&nbsp; lightweight, at the same that it recognizes a number of ways that&nbsp; courses can be vetted and endorsed that won’t hold up the logistical&nbsp; process of creating and publishing them. These additional methods are&nbsp; outlined in the following sections.</p><p></p><p><b>2) Design</b></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>As mentioned above, the School of Open webpage will make clear that no one&nbsp; organization or entity endorses or owns all courses, but rather that&nbsp; courses are created by various members of the community. This will be&nbsp; implemented through:</p><p></p><ul><li>Clear explanations and descriptive text</li>
<li>Visible&nbsp; markers associating courses with specific organizations. For example,&nbsp; any course CC creates will be visibly marked as being created by CC,&nbsp; while any course that Open.Michigan creates will be visibly marked as&nbsp; being created by Open.Michigan.</li>
<li>Individually created and run&nbsp; courses will not carry these markers and it will be clear that they are&nbsp; not associated with any organization.</li></ul>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>3) Community&nbsp;</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As&nbsp; noted above, the community will have the opportunity to give feedback&nbsp; as part of the course review process. In addition, P2PU may implement&nbsp; platform-wide community review tools in the future. As part of P2PU, the&nbsp; School of Open will integrate these and any other tools in&nbsp; collaboration with the larger P2PU community. For example, P2PU may&nbsp; implement a tool whereby a course may be rated for quality by the&nbsp; community. The School of Open will explore these and similar activities&nbsp; with the P2PU community, to ensure sustainability of any School-specific&nbsp; processes or features on the P2PU platform. These features will not&nbsp; serve as barriers to course creation, but will be essential for the&nbsp; continued improvement of courses and participation and ownership by the&nbsp; community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><i>Some things to note</i>:</p><p></p><ul><li>Of&nbsp; course, outside of the School of Open, anyone can still create and&nbsp; publish a course at P2PU at anytime. All P2PU terms and community norms&nbsp; still apply to anything on their site/platform.</li>
<li>The measures&nbsp; outlined above will be implemented in stages in collaboration with the&nbsp; larger P2PU community. Currently, only 1) is immediately implementable;&nbsp; 2) and 3) will require future work.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This course review process will be documented and made transparent on the School of Open web site (this pad).</li></ul>

<h2>FEEDBACK on the course review process above </h2><p></p><ul><li>Add your comment, suggested change here... or if you&rsquo;re comfortable, edit directly above!</li>
<li>How should we mark courses that we create (Design)?</li>
<li>piet:&nbsp; one issue I see with the review process is that a course organizer has&nbsp;&nbsp; no idea where to go from this point, including when to promote it, how&nbsp;&nbsp; long to wait for feedback from the community or from P2PU/CC&nbsp; organizers,&nbsp; etc.</li></ul>
