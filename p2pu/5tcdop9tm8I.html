<body><h1>Community Design Project</h1><p><b>How to Be a Community Manager</b></p><p>&quot;Learn how to be a community manager. In community.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Problem Set:</p><ul><li>Badges can succeed in domains that are being disrupted.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Community managers do work that is often invisible.&nbsp;</li>
<li>No one is focusing on badges that surface community / soft skills.</li></ul>

<p>Solution Set:</p><ul><li>In line with our strategic direction for social learning.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Will recruit social learning people to our cause and build our reputation in this space.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make community manager skills visible, formalize the domain, and sketch out different takes on community.</li></ul>

<p>Potential Partners:</p><ul><li>Project could have a bevy of formal partners who all need community managers but have different &quot;takes&quot; on community: StackExchange, Mozilla, OKFN but also possibly for-profits (who do really interesting things in community mgmt space that we don&rsquo;t know about.)<ul><li>Might be a good space to involve non-tech non-profits too: Red Cross, etc</li></ul>
</ul>

<p>Inspiration</p><ul><li>UX school kickstarter campaign: <a href="http://unicorninstitute.com/"></a><a href='http://unicorninstitute.com/'/>http://unicorninstitute.com/</a></li></ul>

<p>Next steps:</p><ul><li>Can we estimate the size of demand (and is &quot;community manager&quot; the title they are looking for)?<ul><li>Check LinkedIn ads?</li>
<li>Is it being mainstreamed or is this a specialist position?</li>
<li>Funding: a little bit from several strategic partners?</li></ul>
</ul>

<p></p><p>Interview Protocol</p><p></p><p>What does a community manager do?</p><p></p><p>When is a community manager successful?</p><p></p><p>What do you wish you were prepared to do before you had the job?</p><p></p><p>Who do you go to for help / to make decisions?</p><p></p><p>Who are your role models in the Community Management space?</p><p></p><p>How many Community Managers does SoundCloud plain to hire?</p><p></p><p>What would you say is SoundCloudâ€™s approach to community management?</p><p></p></body>
