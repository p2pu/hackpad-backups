[christina] Sure, why not? People may not work together synchronously anyway, and they might be more likely to find use out of the group projects if they&rsquo;re working with others who have similar interests/careers.</p><p></p><p>Encourage people to join with a buddy that they&rsquo;ll do the course with</p><p></p><p><b>Final project:</b> make it be something you work on throughout the course and submit it towards the end</p><p>-- make it like a portfolio of all the work you&rsquo;ve done over the course; submit the last week and we give badges after that</p><p></p><p><b>Badges:</b> Do we want to keep the same badges we had for the same activities?

<li>Jane - kind of out of commission until the 15th</li>
<li>Christina July 5 through July 27, then July 30 through Aug. 3, then Aug 14-23 (but still able to do things with the course during those times b/c will have wifi)</li>
<li>Jeannette - Sept 2 until end (basically, I won&rsquo;t be able to do the last week of the course)</li></ul>

<p><b>Christina&rsquo;s notes taken at the end of the last course, ideas for this time.</b></p><p></p><p>Few used the discussion board, even in first week. Don&rsquo;t know why.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Count on only some of those who register actually starting the course.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Have list of ppl to ask questions, like how to set up blog. Written instructions not enough for some--if struggle, may just give up.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Setting up blog too much? Maybe just post to group blog and have tutorial hangout on how to do that? Set up blog if longer course &amp; can talk about how to do so.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Not many ppl commented on each others&rsquo; blogs. This is a skill it takes time to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Too much to ask to put ppl into groups of strangers &amp; ask to work together? At least maybe give them collab doc to work on? Maybe have a facilitator join the emails so can help organise ppl, rather than hoping one of the participants takes the lead?</p><p></p><p>Make it clear up front that the learning will be p2p rather than from experts. Or have a couple of experts giving presentations? Many ppl may not be used to this style of learning and may not expect this.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Too distributed between p2pu, blog hub/links/twitter archive, course pad. Move from p2pu to WP site?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Get participants&rsquo; social media info at beginning so can contact them that way too --not too many emails. Only if they want, of course.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Maybe start collaborative docs right away--what is open &amp; why open</p><p></p><p>Jeanette: have a discussion at the beginning about expectations of the course, what kind of pedagogy we&rsquo;re using and why</p><p></p></body>
