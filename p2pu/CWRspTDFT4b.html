<body><h1>Social Learning: Roundtable Planning</h1><p></p><p></p><h2>August 20, 2014 Future Planning</h2><p></p><p>Mentorship: September 16</p><p>There are a few organizations doing interesting things in the matchmaking space. One is Thinkful (<a href="http://www.thinkful.com/)"></a>http://www.thinkful.com/) the other is CodeUnion (<a href="http://codeunion.io/)"></a>http://codeunion.io/). I&rsquo;m certainly not into focusing entirely on ed-tech startups, but I do think our last call could have benefitted from a for-profit point-of-view.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Privacy and K-12 Populations: October 14</p><p>I would suggest we ask Karen Brennan from Scratch Ed to come to the panel here.&nbsp;</p><p>+1 ... I would suggest adding a colleague of mine, Robin McClellan who moderates the Noteflight.com composing forums&nbsp; or Joe Berkovitz - the founder of Noteflight about this. I&rsquo;m happy to ask one of them. They are more directly involved in this than I am.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>August 19, 2014 Recap of Learning Analytics</h2><p></p><p>Andrew: In the past we&rsquo;ve tried to bite off more than we can chew - this time is no exception, particularly when it comes to ethics! But we covered a broad range of topics, at a skin-deep level, which is kind of a bummer, because we have great people here, but for the purposes of this call, that was great.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Working on the questions a few days before was very helpful for moderation purposes - gave me a bit of background, and a sense of who to call on for which questions, to get the conversational ball rolling.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I also love how the conversation turned to the humanities vs sciences discussion, which consumes an enourmous amount of my headspace in real life - seems the issues are completely transferable. And I&rsquo;m not sure if any new solutions will come out of the digital world. The kinds of things you learn reading Plato will never be as measurable as those you learn in Physics 101 and I&rsquo;m not sure it even matters. (Although of course it does, if Classics departments have no money...)</li></ul>

<p>Vanessa:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;m surprised at how interwoven these topics are getting--we can&rsquo;t seem to talk about learner pathways without analytics, can&rsquo;t talk about analytics without talking about scale.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Audrey spoke about how those on the panel generally agree about *most* things, it became clear how nuanced the differences are here in the approaches we take. Really enjoyed that about the conversation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Obviously we at P2PU have more thinking to do about privacy--how to inform learners and where that bumps up against influencing the data we&rsquo;re collecting.</li>
<li>None of us come from a ed-tech for-profit/start up, which is a mistake in hindsight. Those are the folks who I&rsquo;d encourage to do this kind of deep thinking. Maybe we should send it to them :)</li></ul>
<ul class="comment"><li>Yes! Or sell it to them...</li></ul>
<ul><li>For me, engagement data is inextricably linked with other sorts of learning data--motivation, community health and learning are all interleaved bits</li></ul>

<p>Audrey: We share values around these things, but this call showed how valued the nuances are - for instance, I find the whole psychometrics thing quite terrifying, but I found the conversation quite subtle. I think we probably disagree about a lot here. Is that a difference between individuals and institutions? I wonder if we still need to define more clearly what we mean by &quot;learning&quot; -- or if, as we did with this discussion, show that it&rsquo;s not a clear-cut thing at all. (In other words, I think there&rsquo;s a value to the messiness of some of this discussion too.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Justin: focussing more on a couple of areas might have been helpful - but we don&rsquo;t know what the audience is. Several of us are working on different platforms which have different periods of engagement, but giving a bit of into on the platforms and the differences between them would have been useful.&nbsp;</p><p>While definitions and frame setting are boring, I also think it may be important. Should we define learning analytics more carefully when talking about it? Does it just mean &quot;educational research with data from computers?&quot; Or something more specific?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Andrew: +1 on diving into the details. We keep generalizing due to the time / speed at which we are covering large areas which leads to a false sense of simplicity. I believe that this is also reflected in the (seeming) lack of differences in values between speakers. Nathan and I, for example, come from WILDLY different approaches to learning (and even how we define learning) but very often have common ground in terms of the problems we face. These differences become more acute when we get into the details of implementation.</p><p></p><p>A view from the quasi-outside here... These calls really are good orientations to the topics through different focal lenses (analytics, scale, etc.). In order to go deeper, we should think about a *different* structure than a short panel.&nbsp; Balancing everyone&rsquo;s time is a challenge, but these are great topics that leave each of us wanting to go deeper and think more. Could we/P2PU create a structure to support this? The dialogue need not be synchronous at all times, of course. Is the place to go deeper in the Community... building a collective knowledge base?</p><p></p><p></p><h2>August 19, 2014: Learning Analytics</h2><p><b>Readings (please add yours!)</b></p><ul><li><br/></li>

<p><b>Questions (please add yours!)</b></p><ul><li>What are the historical origins of &quot;learning analytics&quot;? Why are people paying attention all of the sudden? (Audrey)</li>
<li>What <b><i>should</i></b> we be measuring? How does that stack up against what we <b><i>are</i></b> measuring? (How might &quot;measuring&quot; be a problem in and of itself?)</li>
<li>How do teachers use the output from learning analytics? What are the challenges from informing instruction with data?</li>
<li>What are the ethics of data use? (we&rsquo;re excited about this part - particular topic for Andrew)</li></ul>

<p></p><ul><li>Who does &quot;Learning Analytics&quot; well? (share success story) How did they get there?</li>
<li>Which ideas have shaped your thinking about learning analytics?</li>
<li>Suggestion from Andrew: i think talking a bit about short vs. long term analytics and how the obsession / trends towards short-term lead to focus on specific sets of practices. (might be good to have in our pockets for if we have more time)</li></ul>

<p><b>Format:</b></p><ul><li>This chat will take plan via a hangout on air. It will be on YouTube shortly thereafter :) Concurrently, the audience will be hanging out here: <a href="https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/event/61"></a><a href='https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/event/61'/>https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/event/61</a></li>
<li>Bekka Kahn, our Chief Happiness Officer, will wrangle and moderate our chat.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll each introduce ourselves and say a bit about the communities we serve. You&rsquo;ll also be asked your spirit animal and your fight song. This is *<b><i>very</i></b>* important :)</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll each have a chance to answer the questions we decide on at our Friday meeting.</li>
<li>From there, if we have time, we&rsquo;ll field questions from the audience in the Unhangout (<a href="https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/)"></a><a href='https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/'/>https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/</a>).</li>
<li>The roundtable will last 1 hour, and Bekka will wrap it up.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Please plan to stay an additional 30 minutes for group reflection.</li></ul>

<p><b>Logistics:</b></p><ul><li><b>On Tuesday at 11:45am EST</b> you&rsquo;ll be invited to a google hangout by me. You&rsquo;ll receive the invite via email to this email address.&nbsp;</li>

<li>The P2PU convention is if you&rsquo;d like to speak, type &quot;hand&quot; in the chat.</li>
<li>Please mute yourself until Bekka recognizes it&rsquo;s your turn to speak</li>
<li>We also take notes in a hackpad at the same type--please leave comments and questions there, not in the hangout chat (it disappears after the window closes :/)</li></ul>

<p></p><h2>July 15, 2014: How Do We Bridge the Digital and the Physical?</h2><p></p><p>&nbsp;Lessons from DIY.org, P2PU Khan and NYU Crew</p><p></p><p>Today we approached the second installment on questions of scale in our series &quot;The Big Questions&quot; with Nathan Maton, Community Strategist at the Khan Academy.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Take a look as we tackle:</p><p>- Context setting: is there a binary between online &amp; offline?&nbsp;</p><p>- How do certain tools bridge the gap between online and offline? Examples: Makey Makey, Noteflight.</p><p>- Recommendations for setting consistent spaces</p><p>- How offline contexts/spaces encourage learning to become truly cultural</p><p>- What does anonymity afford? What are the tradeoffs?</p><p>- Does thinking about “offline” separate to online hinder face-to-face experiences?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Andrew Sliwinski</p><ul><li>We are now seeing the emergence of physical communities that are &quot;born&quot; from digital worlds. This has the potential to deepen opportunities for collaboration and lead to greater learning outcomes – how do we help facilitate this?</li>
<li>Can anonymity exist when digital learning becomes physical? (See Vanessa&rsquo;s point below)</li></ul>

<p><a href='/ep/profile/Emzfc9YBdBx'/>Nathan Maton</a></p><ul><li>The goal of whether you&rsquo;re creating long term experiences for a small group of people in the same space or less persistent experiences with more people defines what happens next in designing learning experiences that capture the best from online and offline.</li>
<li>Only online can you do anonymity well, which creates a huge advantage for it for many learning experiences as anonymity allows more flexibility and experimentation on the learners part (although you have to watch out for trolls).</li>
<li>Mobile changes everything when it comes to what happens online and what happens offline. We have so little insight into how that works, and how that create social connections even more so. It&rsquo;s really exciting but tough to imagine how it works outside of the few folks who have smart phones. This is the biggest opportunity to explore how these two environments can work well together. I&rsquo;d love to hear more stories of people doing this.</li>
<li>Thinking about social is tougher when we&rsquo;re thinking about the bridge of two separate spaces. Building community / social experiences is hard enough in one space. Two spaces make it that much tougher.</li></ul>

<p><a href='/ep/profile/xb0845VCfyi'/>Alex Ruthmann</a></p><ul><li>&nbsp;As designers of learning/making communities, the importance of:</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>&nbsp; - Starting by understanding our participants as humans/persons...</li>
<li>&nbsp; - Understanding the blurred nature of our participants&rsquo; locations, spaces and places...</li>
<li>&nbsp; - Providing opportunities for participants to express their personal voice and make choices...</li></ul>
<ul><li>&nbsp;How can we better connect people to our personal and the collective community&rsquo;s learning/content pathways?</li>
<li>&nbsp;Positive affordances of anonymity<ul><li>&nbsp;Research/Terms of Use/Internal Data Collection perspectives: (How) do we balance participants&rsquo; rights and permissions researching and documenting experiences in blurred online/offline environments. (metaphors other than surveillance?)<ul><li>Possible solution - Encourage public documentation such as at <a href="http://buildinprogress.herokuapp.com/"></a>http://buildinprogress.herokuapp.com/ as a reflective/synthesizing aspect of learning/experience design. &quot;Research&quot; and documentation as an integral part of the learning environment - making learning visible and tangible to other participants within and across our communities.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Examples where online anonymity for kids seems to be working:<ul><li><a href="http://noteflight.com/forums"></a>http://noteflight.com/forums</li>
<li><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu"></a>http://scratch.mit.edu</li></ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Vanessa:</p><ul><li>The blurring of online/offline can happen in several ways: supportive information, show evidence for project-based learning, find documentation (though I&rsquo;m most supportive of the project-based learning/evidence scenario)</li>
<li>Good information for our upcoming School of Internet of Things design.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m personally torn between the affordances of anonymity (liberates us from some gender and socioeconomic issues, privacy, nurture vulnerability) and the real-world applications of project-based learning (building a portfolio, showing the evolution of your learnings)</li></ul>
