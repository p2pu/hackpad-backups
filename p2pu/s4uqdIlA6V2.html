<p>There were a couple of things there, though. In the Facebook ToS you consent to your data being used for whatever they want, and they do tell you that your feed might be changed for any reason. So technically, consent was given. *Informed* consent? That&rsquo;s debatable. ;) Also, I think the study was performed having passed an ethical review board, within FB and with collaborators (Cornell, IIRC?)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Thanks Dixie - I&rsquo;ll read this out in a moment : -)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>You&rsquo;ve frozen, Beck/Robert. :)</p><p></p><p>Hi Dixie, can you hear us?&nbsp;</p><p>Nope, can&rsquo;t see you either.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I can see your video...nope, gone again. Group chat in the hangout indicates others can&rsquo;t see you either...Aha! There you are. Carry on. :)</p><p>Great! : -)</p><p></p><p>That&rsquo;s an important question though -- if you&rsquo;re generating the data and doing the experiments, do you have a moral/ethical responsibility to make sure that data is used appropriately? And if you do...can you justify releasing it openly?&nbsp;</p><p>I think with the facebook issue - they could not come up with a valid reason for their research - if they had backed it up with a good ethical reason, people would read it as a more ethical practice in the first place - there are always grey areas.</p><p></p><p>Thanks Eleanor - I&rsquo;ll read out in a moment : -)</p><p></p><p>Robert (thanks for this link!): Netmundial: <a href="http://netmundial.br/"></a><a href='http://netmundial.br/'/>http://netmundial.br/</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Also found article on Netmundial here: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/netmundial"></a>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/netmundial</p><p></p><p>BBC article &quot;Google sets up &rsquo;right to be forgotten&rsquo; form after EU ruling&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27631001"></a>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27631001</p><p></p><p>Digital Humanities at the Open University: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/digital-humanities/"></a>http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/digital-humanities/&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Section 2.2 on Institutional Research (NIH): <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2377/content/4689/"></a>https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2377/content/4689/&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Thank you as well. :)</p><p></p><p>Thanks to everyone for participating in the call! : -)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p></body>
