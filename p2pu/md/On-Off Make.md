# On/Off Make

Investigate ways that a combination of an online and offline community can strengthen each other.

## Proposal

A program where maker spaces around the world offer internships to 2-5 students per maker space. Students from the different maker spaces work through a project based curriculum to step them through basic electronics, programming,  manufacturing, printing, crowd funding & scaling to production.

The Maker spaces provide infrastructure and the students' expert community (in addition to everything that is online).

The online community is the class for all the students in different maker spaces and they connect and share regularly using online tools. 

## Projects

Projects are suggested to learn a possible set of skills. The projects should not be prescriptive and allow the development of different skills suitable to individuals and maker spaces.

1.  <s>Make a tee shirt (screen printing)</s>
2.  <s>Automate a mechanical task (Arduino, RaspberryPi, 3d printing, laser cutting, mechanics)</s>
3.  <s>Create your own board game (Laser cutting, screen printing, casting)</s>
4.  <s>Crowd fund one of your projects (crowd funding, marketing, finances, registering a company)</s>
5.  <s>Build your own arcade (RaspberryPi, Arduino, mechanics, programming)</s>

## Success metrics

1.  Ongoing engagement in the Maker community after completion
2.  Concrete projects that came out of the program
3.  Tenable skills
4.  High completion rate

## Questions

1.  Who recruits/decides what students to give internships?
2.  Does a Maker space need to be a certain size to host interns?
3.  Does a Maker space need certain equipment to host interns?
4.  Should we do a survey to determine if Maker spaces would be interested?
5.  How many students and maker spaces?
6.  Full time vs part time
7.  How to make it scale? More maker spaces? More interns? Other spaces. Business?
8.  Do we currently have funding for this?

**Next steps**

1.  Talk with potential partner(s)
2.  Talk with possible maker spaces

Hi Dirk, I'm new to hackpadding so I'm sure this probably isn't the right place to ask you questions about this hackpad, but I'll try anyway. If there is a better place, please point me to it. I started a maker space and have been meeting weekly with youth since last October (see [](http://cachemakers.weebly.com/))[http://cachemakers.weebly.com/](http://cachemakers.weebly.com/)). We've done scratch, LEGO Mindstorms, 3d design, laser cutting, starting to work on 3d printing and be will working with VEX robotics. We have two groups of about 15 kids ages 9-15. I've been thinking about maker curriculum and the idea of how to support online and offline interaction for small groups like others including interacting with other groups. I'd love to hear your thinking about this and if you have taken the brainstorm represented in this page anywhere?

Hey [Joel Duffin](/ep/profile/ECcgXwLVX3v) - no problem reaching out here, hackpad managed to get an email to me :) We (P2PU) have a discussion forum here: thepeople.p2pu.org where some people are hanging out and discussing things like this. This idea in this hackpad has been feeding into [](http://schoolofiot.org/)[http://schoolofiot.org/](http://schoolofiot.org/) which is different from the original idea. You may find this thread ([](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/meetup-groups-around-a-p2pu-course/456))http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/meetup-groups-around-a-p2pu-course/456) of interest about online/offline. One thing that is also worth pointing out - working with youth and online communities has some considerations that I'm not informed about (I vaguely know the US has some requirements wrt this). Any case, nice meeting you :)

Thanks for your response [Dirk Uys](/ep/profile/ppBMkttdzda)! The course you pointed me to looks great, I'll be checking it out more and sharing it with my maker group. I've run into the P2PU forums before and should have realized that would be a good place to interact. Yes, the issues regarding youth are important to what I'm doing, for now we have both a private google community and email list for sharing amongst the youth, but are sharing publicly via our website and a flickr page. So at this point, should I delete this conversation from this hackpad since it should probably live somewhere else?

I think it's fine to leave the conversation here, but probably best to continue on [](http://thepeople.p2pu.org)[http://thepeople.p2pu.org](http://thepeople.p2pu.org) where other people will also see it and can weigh in.
