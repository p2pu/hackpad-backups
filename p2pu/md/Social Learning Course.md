# Social Learning Course

## Nov 5, 2014

Agenda:

*   Current status (~70%): [](http://howto.p2pu.org/)http://howto.p2pu.org/
*   what is 100% look like?

        *   a 4-5 week facilitated course
    *   robust social / peer-learning elements
    *   target: facilitated 'beta' launching 17 Dec, to run 5 weeks

                *   Audience: invite the ~10 people already touching the course to participate in the beta: Bekka+Dirk
        *   Content: spend the next 10 days polishing the content in the course (Projects, copy, technical)
        *   Feedback and evaluation: Erika? 
        *   Marketing: for the beta - primarily just personal invites to known people? Bekka + Dirk. Copy to be done for the PURL front page, just announcing there will be a beta.
        *    Facilitation during the beta: [Dirk Uys](/ep/profile/ppBMkttdzda) & [Erika Pogorelc](/ep/profile/oTNkHa0lFrI)
        *   In Jan will iterate from beta

        *   target: "open sign-up" 1 Feb
**   What do we need to get it to 100%?
    *   Evaluation of "Projects"

                *   **Next steps**: DU to ping VMG, EP, BK for feedback - 

                        *   feedback will happen in different places, Dirk to specify. 

        *   getting feedback from users

                *   VMG Suggestion: follow Nicole Fenton, Natalie Green (people doing the course), have a meeting with them 1x/week
        *   BK Suggestion: John Cummings & Stuart Prior from Wikimedia UK would probably have useful insights.
        *   CR: or at least reach out on discourse/email and invite feedback from them, in whatever format their willing to give (def ask for a meeting)
        *   Test - could build this into first iteration / follow up? 

                        *   appeal, is the content engaging, did you meet interesting people?
            *   recall  - did it help you
            *   and what people would say about a project in their own words
            *   Nomenclature: did you know where to go, 

                *   **Next steps**:

                        *   get feedback from beta users (DU)
            *   build in feedback during the course (EP)

        *   Dedicated space for feedback and feature requests

                *   Suggestion: use GitHub issues and have folks vote on changes - but noting issue of voting creating expectations
        *   Use the feedback process to grow the audience and engage others

        *   User testing/formative evaluation (appeal, recall, messaging)
    *   Case studies/following a few users throughout their experience for the front page

*   marketing plan

        *   what are we selling? - 

                *   "a course where people can easily create re-usable courses together with other people"
        *   Not too technical
        *   Has community design in it
        *   Will result in things that can be used after the course

        *   **Next steps**: 

                *   reach out to people who already expressed interest
        *   reach out to people we want feedback from

                        *   Laura, Jane, Dave Cormier, Nicole Fenton, Natalie Green

*   facilitation

        *   responsibilities & expectations

                *   Dirk to facilitate one or two
        *   Do a google hangout once a week
        *   Start November 17th?

        *   attach specified date to modules (week 1, week 2, etc)
    *   **next steps**:

                *   come up with a schedule

## Sept 25, 2014

*   Should the modules be sequential?
*   What is the time period we want to run the course in?

        *   1 module a week

*   Soft launch at Mozilla Fest
*   Plan for School in a box being more important Feb 2015
*   Break down what is needed from Vanessa.

## August 27, 2014

*   Recap from 22 Aug

        *   Integrate PURL and howto.p2pu.org
    *   Work with people signed up
    *   Present it at MozFest / Open Ed in November
    *   Work on making the technical easier

                *   Prose.io-->Dirk evaluating now
        *   Later-->help people fork their courses (for now fork on GitHub, can make it easier later)

*   Structure of course

        *   To Do: Align projects to learning objectives
    *   Tools + learning at the same time
    *   Move tools to first module
    *   GitHub Reference

                *   Make github cheatcheat to be a reference that folks can refer to often
        *   Post a link to it to Discourse so others can reference
        *   Update it periodically based on questions that people have
        *   Tools-->change heading / name (References?)

        *   Each project has a learning piece and a technical piece
    *   Point people community.p2pu.org-->edutinkerers

                *   Eventually work towards single-sign on for community.p2pu and discourse.p2pu

*   Design principles

        *   Learning + technical bits at the same time
    *   We will scaffold this for you
    *   Simplicity + playful
    *   Get people involved straight from the start (build kinetic energy and keep it)

*   Naming ideas

        *   Course in a box metaphor-->keeping it self-contained
    *   Coloring book-->visual guide for people

*   /backmatter

[adding my comments from Hipchat, having cleared up my Hackpad access issues :)]

CR suggestion: 

*   focus on the Course in a Box content first, then build the Social Learning Course around it.  Ie build the CiaB content first, then add the pedagogy layer on top.
*   build modularly - get a CiaB landing page up ASAP, with overview of what q's/issues will be addressed, and build out the modules progressively
*   ongoing project - this shouldn't be buit just once and left to stand.  Should be living repository - after every showcase we should be touching one or two (or more) of the modules to update with latest lessons learned.
*   Maybe distinction between CiaB and SL Course is it's the CiaB content we're updating most frequently, while the Course content can stay more static (if we can design to point to the CiaB materials, in a content-blind way - ie will always work and make sense even as we update the underlying CiaB subject-matter material)
*   DU: Mmm, the course should be the living part where community interacts. Saying that is could be static sounds like we're creating a web page.  Agreed.

PS: 

*   Slides focus on promoting ideas and getting <u>buy-in</u>, what we need is <u>how-to</u>

Outline of course / Course Ideas

*   Value proposition: Why an Open Learning Course?

*   should we also include online?

*   Design a community of practice that is engaged and evolving
*   Empower others to cultivate digital identities on the web
*   Use the wealth of resources the web has to offer--not one platform or product

*   Community design: 

*   cohorts assigned / cohorts of choice 
*   feedback mechanisms

*   Choice of tools

*   Social tools:

        *   one to many

*   Tech tools
