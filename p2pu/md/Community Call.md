    *   hackpad backups: requires manual download of hackpads (but only takes a min). erika will do this once a week for now. 

*   Turned off the old archive.p2pu.org hosting (it was migrated to a better place, and nobody even noticed)
*   Tech strategy

        *   Plan going forward:

                *   Archive old platforms (most of lernanta, archive.p2pu.org, etherpad). Move away from hosting platform. 
        *   Critically look at how best to support existing projects wrt new strategy (courses, mechanical MOOC and badges)
        *   Build/find missing the pieces of the “Open educators technology toolkit”

**Priorities**

**Problems**

**Process**

**Agenda for discussion:**

**Report on OER university launch Nov. 1**:

*   Opportunity for strong link between formal and informal education
*   University courses (or mini-courses) can be offered in a way that is open to free/worldwide enrollment
*   [](http://oeruniversity.net)http://oeruniversity.net
*   Example with 2 free mini courses: [](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40460?utm_campaign=sm&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitter1)http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40460?utm_campaign=sm&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitter1
*   Current partners are mainly from formal background. 
*   Main message: be engaged! These people want to know about informal education, badges, etc. Next time there is a meeting, somebody from P2PU should attend!
