The course is free, online, and open to anyone who wants to participate. It is peer-powered by [P2PU](https://p2pu.org/en/), and you can follow the five week curriculum starting on February 23rd or join in later if you want to go at your own pace.  This course has been created to reach both those who are brand new to littleBits as well as those who have some experience with bits. 

**Our Learning Philosophy**

*   We believe that learning should be interest-driven. You'll work on projects that are of your choosing, and dazzle or entrance you. No dry videos, no quizzes.
*   Good learning is open and participatory. Anyone can join, anyone can contribute and we create a safe space so anyone can speak.
*   We're community-powered. We're in this together. We are always teaching and learning at the same time.
*   And we're playful. We believe that you'll learn best when you are having fun. 

**What will you learn?**

*   How to make your ideas come to life! And how to make the most of your bits.
*   How to design and run your own meetups, workshops and events.

**What To Expect?**

*   During the course you will make **at least two new projects**
*   During our **weekly Community Call **you will get to work in small teams with other bit'sters
*   The course will culminate in a global make-a-thon with everyone who took the course. 
*   All along the way, you'll have support **on our active forums** from littleBits staff and bit'sters like you!
