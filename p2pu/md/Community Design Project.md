**How to Be a Community Manager**

"Learn how to be a community manager. In community."

Problem Set:

*   Badges can succeed in domains that are being disrupted. 
*   Community managers do work that is often invisible. 
*   No one is focusing on badges that surface community / soft skills.

Solution Set:

*   In line with our strategic direction for social learning. 
*   Will recruit social learning people to our cause and build our reputation in this space. 
*   Make community manager skills visible, formalize the domain, and sketch out different takes on community.
