# The Public Mapping Mission

**Notes // Dec 2 **

Call with [Nicholas Johnson](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/profile/G3QB4ry3cY4)

0) Put together slides/workshop presentation

1) Nick is coordinating the event in NYC w/ help of Liz & PL Newtown community. 

2) We need to send an email to see who is able to do this? On a personal level.

3) 'Plant public mappers'? 

**Hi Philipp and Drew:**

We're sending out emails today to confirm the participants for Saturday and their mapping locations.  The current plan is to have Nick launch a hangout at 11AM to go over the mapping process(putting the kits together, what to expect etc).  What link should we use? What else do we need for the setup for the hangout? 

Ideally, Nick will walk through the process of setting up the balloon in 45 minutes from start to finish.  Then, the NYC team will meet up at 12:30 to do the mapping. We'll sign back on to a hangout at 5:00PM with everyone else to share discoveries.

At this moment, we don't know how many teams we have, but should hear back from everyone by tomorrow morning.  

Thanks, 

**Hi Public Mappers!!**

Thanks for all of you who participated in the Public Mapping Mission online seminar. Here is the [link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X3VriZ74Ao) if you missed it. 

In preparation for Part II of the series, Saturday's mapping activity, we need to confirm whether you are planning on mapping a location in your community. The game plan is to check-in online at 11AM EST via hangout for a balloon/kite mapping workshop, then go mapping in respective communities and finally, reconvene online at 5PM EST to share experience and discoveries.  

Please let us by the end of the day today your responses to the following questions: 

1) Are you planning on leading a mapping expedition?

2) Where you're planning on mapping? 

3) Have you organized a team? 

4) Do you need to be connected to an existing team? If so, where are you located? 

5) Have you purchased the necessary equipment? You can purchase the balloon / kite kit here: [](http://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-kit)http://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-kit. Order soon, so that the kit arrives on time!

We've already confirmed a team in New York who are planning an expedition to map Newton Creek!  If you are based in NYC and want this team, please let us know. 

We look forward to hearing from you,

Cosmo and Nick
