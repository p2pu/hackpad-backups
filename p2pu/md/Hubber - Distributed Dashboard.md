# Hubber / Distributed Dashboard

**Problem Set: **

*   Using the web as a platform means cobbling together several tools and services. 
*   As an "unplatform" and open learning community, it's difficult to retrieve reliable data from the different services we use. 
*   In "Play With Your Music" we couldn't gather the data to show networked interactions across SoundCloud, YouTube and G+.
*   As a result, we have difficulty showing funders that we are making an impact, or knowing which knobs to turn to improve our learning experiences.

**Solution Set: **

*   Develop a tool that pulls data from from distributed platforms and communities. 
*   Work with Google research, SoundCloud, Discourse, TAGSExplorer to create a dashboard for distributed learning tools. 
*   Unlike the traditional dashboard that shows individual users' performance against each other, we will measure community health--connectedness between the nodes, # of user-generated threads, character-count length of responses.

*   Any examples of traditional dashboards?
*   VMG: khan academy, blackboard dashboard, Knewton dashboard. Traditionally monitor personalized learning, eg, what you got right/wrong, time on site. Doesn't measure connection between people or interaction.

*   For others to use, they would need to insert the URL to their various communities to get started.

Potential Funder:

Knight Prototype Fund

Deadline: August 1, 2014

$35,000 for a 6-month project

"The Prototype Fund supports a broad spectrum of ideas related to media, data and information. We are interested in any new models or technology to inform communities."

Possible Data sources

*   Discourse (comments and interaction between users)
*   Google Drive (collaboration on documents - will need to share docs with user or create doc through API and send links to users)
*   Twitter - tracking hash tags, interactions between course participants
*   Sign ups
*   Badges on badges.p2pu.org
*   Email campaings -> opens & clicks
*   Facebook
*   Web searches for certain keywords
*   Articles published on participant blogs

Type of things we want to track

*   User interaction

        *   sharing each others work
    *   communication across platforms
    *   providing feedback

*   User activity
*   Cohort activity/health

Ideas and questions

*   User correlation? How do we associate users' different online profiles?
*   Privacy? At what stage does this start feeling like big brother is watching? Do we only show public data or private data also?

**Prototype**

Focus on writing4change course.

*   Questions we want to answer

        *   is the community healthy
    *   are cohorts working/sticky

*   Data sources of interest

        *   Google docs (or other platform if writing happens there)
    *   Twitter
    *   Discourse
    *   Other social media (blogs, Facebook, ??)

*   What we want to measure: 

        *   Number of interactions between people
    *   Length of interactions between people
    *   Number of engaged people in a cohort
    *   Type of interaction -> like/+1, sharing, feedback, collaboration, 

*   What we want to build

        *   Tools to get the data (integration with APIs)
    *   Dashboard to visualize and display the data
    *   Exporting/packaging data for release

Future

*   Support standard data sources (twitter, discourse, etc)
*   Ability to add custom data source relevant for a course/community. Ex. sharing audio is relevant to PWYM. Feedback and collaboration on writing is relevant to Writing4Change. Popcorn & Thimble is relevant to Webmaker Training.
