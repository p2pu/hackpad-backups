# Notes from March 4 Community Call

Do you miss the space shuttle? What do NASA folks think of new players like SpaceX?

Pardon the pun, what do you see is the frontier in discovery of space for kids?

*   David: what's your fave project video (without or without you)
*   What are some of Davids fav tools in the shop?
*   Are there any specific areas you always tinker around?
*   What's the most difficult part of a project for you? Is it idea creation? Execution?
*    Are there any specific areas you always tinker around?
*   As a designer, are you thinking of each new bit discretely and independently or always in the context of how it would "fit" with larger kits or likely projects?

Question 2: When was the last time you were in awe of science? Was it a space museum? A fishing trip? Reading a psychology article? How could you use littleBits to re-create that experience? (Silently brainstorm in the chat for 5 mins)

I was inspired by cosmos recently
