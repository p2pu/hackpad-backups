Badges and beyond - Linkedin and other credentialling ideas

As regular readers would know, P2PU was an early and active developer of a badges platform, fostering an [ecosystem for micro-credentialling](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/) that remains in use to this day. Finding fast and flexible ways to report mastery of skills that matter remains a challenging problem. 

We are always chuffed, then, to see learners finding new ways of reporting their achievements - for example as [educational milestones](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=107824461&authType=OUT_OF_NETWORK&authToken=PrGk&locale=en_US&srchid=1168123891416946867343&srchindex=5&srchtotal=89&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A1168123891416946867343%2CVSRPtargetId%3A107824461%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary) in their [Linkedin profiles](https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/f?type=all&keywords=p2pu&orig=GLHD&rsid=&pageKey=member-home&trkInfo=). 

This is a great example of how online communities find new ways to report competencies. Flexible frameworks, portfolios of achievement, peer-endorsements...there are so many valid alternatives to the traditional college transcript.
