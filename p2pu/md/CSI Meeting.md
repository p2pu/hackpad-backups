# CSI Meeting

Background:

*   Met with Evan and Dave a few times

        *   Interested in similar ... topics / questions / challenges (?)

*   What are your goals for a learning program/project - where are you at right now? 

        *   What are you unsure about / trying to figure out?
    *   Who is the audience you are working toward?
    *   Timeline for experiments:  Content experiment side/tech side

Even calling it learning "program" may be too sophisticated

We don't know what we are doing

CSI Toronto, 10 years old

2,000 members

physical space

**=> CSI: The future for us is in the online world**

Trying to figure out what that means

Developing "pathways" to social innovation

CSI is a magnetic attractor (corporate drop-outs, new grads, activists ... )

What are the tools (content) we need to provide to them

What is our engagement process? 

700 organizations -> 25% are content providers, professional educators, consultants. 

How they can be not the content developer, but the platform / connection nexus

Help them find each other

Unschool--their model (project that Evan is working on): 

*   Badges included
*   P2P learning embedded (in the thinking)

Trying to build a Learning dashboard for every learner

*   Navigation engine to find the right tools/content
*   P2P Learning is only one third of our interest (metrics and project management, access to other collaborative spaces CSI provides access to)
*   They host 1500 events
*   Nobody knows what's going on, what clusters of events exist
*   Part of this should be a recommendation engine for events, mentoring, coaching

Tech/IT/Intranet is strangling them

Have resources--funding

They don't want to run the technology-->partner with others who do that

Core problem they are trying to focus on is not online courses

Should we develop a badge/accreditation system for social innovation. Started with 3 components: Collaboration, Social enterprise, Social innovation

*   Building out their tech team 
*   Looking to recruit a tech integrator / tech director

Online doorway that gets people into this space (Who is the user: internal community-better knowledge sharing, or onboarding new people?)

Tonya: "CSI **is NOT** in the content business, we are in the aggregation / curation business" / creating a network of physical spaces

Very excited about crowd-revue of events

Anyone who wants to be a content provider can be, will book their CSI space online

Revenue

*   Membership model. $30 a month. 
*   Event fees
*   Value-add services / physical space management.

How big are they going to get? Been approached by 100 coworking spaces to create a network for social innovation

Convene people around sectors

*   Vetting of individual members / linkedin for social innovators 

Thinking through the different "learning needs" that social innovators have

*   Where are they at, and what would be the right next step? 

What's the problem we are trying to solve? 

People need peer-learners

Learning online can be lonely 

Turn content into learning communities

Small tools that are flexible

Are you marketing to a mass market, or going into sub-community to offer B2B P2P services? 

I couldn't 

Are you not going after the generic mass audience anymore? 

We are, but we are trying to get there a different way

P: 2-3 ideas that we'd be excited about, sit with it

Send before Saturday

Have some crappy ideas 

Tonya's Recs:

*   Tonya: Send pitch materials, product materials, circulate to the team, product specs
*   Specs chart--they will look for something that describes the product
*   Her nerds will look for products and services that meet those requirements
*   ie: learning pathways
*   **_Put a box around what we offer in a clearer way _**
*   **_Also show the core staff and what they can do_** (she didn't know we had a tech team)

(Internal) Notes

*   What about something like the General Assembly model? (with more online). Very hands-on face to face courses, that generate revenue. 
*   Open IDEO? 
*   Grouping and cohorts-->finding each other at similar points in the process
*   Vetting of course material--is the material good enough to be at CSI level
*   Want early version of Skillshare (not the one with online content)
*   How can the tech tool anchor 1st interaction but also be paid/premium product? Difficult to do both.
*   Identifying learning pathways / different stages
