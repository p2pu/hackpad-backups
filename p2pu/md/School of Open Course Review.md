# School of Open Course Review

## School of Open Course Review Process

_How can my course join the School of Open? _

1.  Check your course against the [School of Open Guidelines](/School-of-Open-Guidelines). Still interested?
2.  Join the [Discussion](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/category/school-of-open). Post a draft of your course to the group and ask for feedback.
3.  Iterate and improve.
4.  Seek the final review of a School of Open organizer and make final changes.
5.  Share a link to the published course with the group.

We will add your course once it has undergone the review process. You can read the community's rationale behind the course review  process below.

## School of Open Course Review Rationale

_This is the rationale behind the course review process as reached by the community._

The  School of Open is foremost a community initiative, with courses being  built by both individuals and organizations across the various “open”  movements. No one organization claims responsibility or endorsement of  all School of Open courses. The School aims to support existing  education efforts within these “open” movements via the courses they  create as part of the School of Open, and each course will be clearly  identified with its creator. 

In addition to building and  facilitating courses, collaborating organizations and individuals will  collect feedback and improve their courses through community review  (process outlined below). Moreover, all School of Open courses are  licensed by default under CC BY-SA, the default P2PU platform license,  so iterative improvements are encouraged and shared back with the  community, in addition to being freely and legally available to all. 

In  collaboration with the School of Open community, the following course  review process has been outlined for the School. This process will be  implemented in stages, and will remain flexible for future iteration as  the community’s needs shift and grow. 

**Background**

Work-flow  approval processes are already in place for all P2PU Schools; only the  School’s organizer may designate a course as being part of that School.  Furthermore, only the School’s organizer or P2PU administrator may make  any changes to the design or layout of the School’s webpage. These  technical measures prevent any course from being added to a School  without the organizer’s approval. The School of Open’s organizers  currently include staff from CC and P2PU, in addition to volunteers  affiliated with the University of Michigan’s Open.Michigan initiative. 

**1) Process**

In  order for a course to be published as part of the School of Open, it  must have undergone review and incorporated the feedback of two or more School of Open organizers. Since the School of Open is a joint  initiative being coordinated by CC and P2PU, one organizer from each  organization must review and provide feedback before the course can be  added to the School of Open webpage. Furthermore, this review must take  place openly and transparently (e.g. on a public mailing list or the  course platform) so that the community may have ample opportunity to  engage with course organizers and give feedback for improvement prior to  a decision. Additional parties, such as content or domain experts, may  be pulled into review a course on a case-by-case basis. This process  does not apply to draft or in-development courses which are clearly  noted as such on the School of Open page. 

Reviews will take  place in the context of a set of evolving, community created guidelines  for what is and is not a School of Open course at [](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/School-of-Open-Guidelines)<u>https://p2pu.hackpad.com/School-of-Open-Guidelines</u>. As the School of Open grows, these guidelines may morph into a set of  published standards; as the project currently stands, the community  agrees that the recommended guidelines are flexible enough to meet the  needs of a course review process and to serve as initial guidance for  new course creators seeking to join the School.

The community  agrees that the course review process must remain flexible and  lightweight, at the same that it recognizes a number of ways that  courses can be vetted and endorsed that won’t hold up the logistical  process of creating and publishing them. These additional methods are  outlined in the following sections.

**2) Design**

_ _

As mentioned above, the School of Open webpage will make clear that no one  organization or entity endorses or owns all courses, but rather that  courses are created by various members of the community. This will be  implemented through:

*   Clear explanations and descriptive text
*   Visible  markers associating courses with specific organizations. For example,  any course CC creates will be visibly marked as being created by CC,  while any course that Open.Michigan creates will be visibly marked as  being created by Open.Michigan.
*   Individually created and run  courses will not carry these markers and it will be clear that they are  not associated with any organization.

**3) Community **

As  noted above, the community will have the opportunity to give feedback  as part of the course review process. In addition, P2PU may implement  platform-wide community review tools in the future. As part of P2PU, the  School of Open will integrate these and any other tools in  collaboration with the larger P2PU community. For example, P2PU may  implement a tool whereby a course may be rated for quality by the  community. The School of Open will explore these and similar activities  with the P2PU community, to ensure sustainability of any School-specific  processes or features on the P2PU platform. These features will not  serve as barriers to course creation, but will be essential for the  continued improvement of courses and participation and ownership by the  community.   

_Some things to note_:

*   Of  course, outside of the School of Open, anyone can still create and  publish a course at P2PU at anytime. All P2PU terms and community norms  still apply to anything on their site/platform.
*   The measures  outlined above will be implemented in stages in collaboration with the  larger P2PU community. Currently, only 1) is immediately implementable;  2) and 3) will require future work. 
*   This course review process will be documented and made transparent on the School of Open web site (this pad).

## FEEDBACK on the course review process above 

*   Add your comment, suggested change here... or if you're comfortable, edit directly above!
*   How should we mark courses that we create (Design)?
*   piet:  one issue I see with the review process is that a course organizer has   no idea where to go from this point, including when to promote it, how   long to wait for feedback from the community or from P2PU/CC  organizers,  etc.
*   Suggest adding some info on how long the approval and design process might be. I know there are a lot of variables, but an estimate of ow much time from start to finish the course review process might take would be helpful.
