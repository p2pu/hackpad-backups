**Agenda for discussion**

<u>2 Big issues for discussion:</u>

*   knowing what we're all working on
*   time management at personal level

<u>1 - Knowing what each other are working on</u>

*   Could do better - still don't feel confidence knowing what's keeping the org busy
*   Currently too "intransparent" in one-on-one conversations
*   Better check-in in community call
*   Set up major projects Trello board and look at the changes together during community call
*   Carl to set something up for next community call.

<u>2 - Knowing what I'm working on - time management - How we get a lot of work done, without burning out, and while having a good time</u>

*   _We had a somewhat heated conversation by email about tracking our own time_
*   _Let's clarify what we are trying to do with time tracking_
*   _Let's find a solution for personal and org management that works for us_
*   Doing time keeping from a **reflection** point of view (not accountability!)
*   The most important thing about time sheets is to not lie ;-)

        *   The easiest way to do that is to track time for yourself, without thinking about an audience

*   let's do timesheets for a week and see what we learn about self! To discuss at next community meeting.

<u>Music MOOC Update</u>

*   Community newsletter: [](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5tWnajPyvXDWUI4RWJFQ3ZQeDg/edit?usp=sharing)https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5tWnajPyvXDWUI4RWJFQ3ZQeDg/edit?usp=sharing

<u>Blog facelift</u>

*   Blog is a bit ugly, what can we do?
*   DU: If we move the blog platform more (going forward) we should give it an upgrade

--- 

<u>Webcraft Proposal</u>

*   Need to pick this up. 

<u>Online Educa presentation</u>

*   Refining the "story" of why our work is relevant
*   This is one attempt/ angle we can take
