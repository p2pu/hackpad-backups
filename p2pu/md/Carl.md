**Parking lot**

## February 4 - office hours

Anything people want to ask/discuss?

*   Internet of Things proposal - Dirk & I did a first cut budget/proposal; interested in getting others thoughts for a second draft, before circulating more widely
*   Budget stuff- 2014 to finalise..
*

Some things I'm working on:

Budgets

Outstanding grant commitments

New proposals - School of Webmaking, Internet of Things

Things I'd like to talk abou if there's time & interest:

_nb guessing I'm not the only one interested in this stuff; always happy to discuss in other calls but happy to kick off here if there's time_

*   2014 - what's on? would like to look at year ahead and think where stuff might fit - outstanding mindsets & labs work, our own course on open, SoW, SoThings, what else??

        *   BK: <s>there are enough people for another Python MOOC whenever we're ready</s>, and the LCL iteration, also SOO courses launching in the coming weeks. 
    *   Not quite enough people for the Python MOOC yet, but we can make it so...

*   openness vs transparency - in a totally open org, is there anything better discussed internally?  I think so, but hard line to draw.  Interested in others thoughts.

IoT proposal - progressing with Dirk, Cesar, Marc - time to put actual proposal down?

## December 19

Progressing: 

*   board papers:

        *   roadmap / operational plan - next priority.  Aiming for next draft to P by end of week, hopefully we can get to board in first/second week Jan
    *   2014 budget - with board in draft; Karen available to finalise in w/c 13 Jan. 

                *   Sharing with the team? what form?

        *   ED job ad - with board in draft - no idea how they'll progress / what more they'll want from us
    *   org position summaries ('org chart') - with board in draft - unclear how will be used; am hoping won't be publicly released as part of job ad doc pack (have asked this of D but no response)
    *   others?

                *   end of year report / update on strat plan implementation?

*   website update

        *   story behind p2pu.org domain?  
    *   pulling together the elements into a roadmap & progressing

                *   courses: lernanta archiving - to be done in phases; Dirk and Erika onboard; first blogpost early Jan
        *   community: building out blog & discourse
        *   knowledge sharing: 

                        *   refocus on reporting/analytics out of all projects 
            *   content mapping with Bekka

                                *   new courses: need a course on teaching online courses
                *   tagging old posts
                *   working out what's missing from info.p2pu.org & howto incorporate
                *   brag sheet - history of projects page - me and Bekka will do a draft

                *   wishlist: revisit old projects to check we've done knowledge capture from them.  Eg reporting on badges? ... lower priority but want to work back as well as forward in time, from present.
        *   framework - landing page and second level pages still a moving feast - still workshopping ideas

*   projects:

        *   Music MOOC: PG licensing has been timeconsuming but progressing.  Will file docs somewhere for a lessons learned/future reference.
    *   IoT: 

Done:

*   org WIP board - will trial it in 1-on-1's then discuss in next community call whether useful / how to proceed
*   PG licensing - bit of work to get it in order but now just moving through the pipeline.  Will be handing off to NYU to finalis
*   2014 budget; ED ads

## November 21

Progress

onboarding:

*   attending 1-on-1's to get a feel for current workload, projects, priorities

        *   _useful to get feel for personal prefs vs org prefs, workload involved in admin (continuous overhead) vs 'projects'_

*   blog post with Bekka
*   profile at p2pu.org? blogpost? mailing list blast? (suggested by trello onboarding)
*   [Philipp Schmidt](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi) - other steps? any reach-outs / conversations you want me to have with others?
*   admin/accounts setup seems complete
*   salary/invoicing - talked to Bekka - advised to email invoices to money@p2pu.org eg on last day of month.

strategy implementation:

*   1-on-1 discussions with all staff (now complete):

        *   keen to implement strategy doc (move from talk to do)
    *   will be additive not destructive
    *   my gut feel is 'knowledge hub' will be biggest change
    *   stay tuned for all hands discussion

*   need to discuss with Philipp implementation strat (strat for the strat!) - what / where / how much / how fast to push (my thinking: lead but don't push - lets be evolutionary not revolutionary)
*   all hands call tbc for early next week. Agenda at [Website strategy](/FutFPwsNev8).`
*   Lernanta future?

strategy doc v2.0:

*   Implementation plan further to strategy doc - next 6 mths, next 12 mths

contracts:

Priorities

*   website strategy: implementation - all hands call, talking points for that call; then roadmap out of that call
*   other projects for Carl? - anything else you want me looking at? anywhere in particular you want my focus? - Nope: website plus ongoing stuff looks sufficient for full plate.

Problems

Process

*   continue sitting in on 1-on-1 calls
*   Erika starting 1-on-1's? Vanessa wants change time?

To-do:
