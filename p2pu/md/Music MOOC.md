# Music MOOC

## Next Steps 2.0 April 15 2014

[](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/vanessa)https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/vanessa

**1. Grouping mechanism.** Do we replicate last time, but put people into more groups, plus the old groups? Or, do we program a new solution that more easily (I spoke with Paul Lamere about this last week) maps new people onto our EXISTING groups?

[Dirk Uys](/ep/profile/ppBMkttdzda): is there a way to get help from Echonest from this? can you contract it to P2PU?

[Alex Ruthmann](/ep/profile/xb0845VCfyi): poke around community to see if there's someone interested in helping

[Vanessa Gennarelli](/ep/profile/Cw53PwvRgVD): vanessa to do research on good way to do subcommunities and channels

How can use the echnonest / discourse communities? 

**2. I need clarification on mailgun/mandrill, etc.** For example, do we want to potentially simplify things by emulating the LCL model of more simply posting the content to [](http://community.playwithyourmusic.org/)[http://community.playwithyourmusic.org/](http://community.playwithyourmusic.org/) forgetting about Mechanical MOOC, or is there benefit of using Mechanical MOOC?

Mailchimp vs. Mailgun: are they sending out structured reminders via email?

Reminders via mailchimp-->the pathway is seeded via the mailchimp emails

Allow people to flexibly move through the content-->mail organizes the cohort

Signup for a different email list for a different iteration of the course-->like a queuing system

Costs for support:

Tech support time

Subscriptions:

*   Digital Ocean: $20
*   Mandrill: emails for forum (almost free)
*   Herouku hosting the front page (can move this to github pages)-->we're currently managing signups there 
*   Mailchimp: $75/month (Would need to move the signup to mailchimp) up to 10,000 subscribers (it's possibly NYU owns a license) 

**3. Site Design.** I’m leaning toward a similar site design as LCL where the course tab headers stay present, with the Discourse community appearing below when a “Community” tab would be clicked. This implies some back end shuttling/dev time for [PWYM.org](http://pwym.org/)

4. Badges. To badge, or not to badge? 

_To Badge!_

5. Visual design. Is there anything in terms of logo, identity, etc that should be tightened up and contracted for?

6. Eventual migration to NYU…  What are the outstanding services/systems that are not directly under NYU’s management? I’m not saying we need to transition immediately. I think it makes sense to do that later in the year. But, I’d like to know what I need to plan for. This is timely because my Dean is leaving office soon and has promised resources, so I need to know what to ask for (in terms of technical support, subscriptions, $$, technologies, etc.).

7.) PR / Community MGMT

*   When can we release & publish the report?
*   Send to all members of 1.0 and invite to join discourse
*   Also want to send the report and announce to all the press contacts who covered us

Mid-May to end-of-may as the launch date

Change the front page this week

Monday?

8.) Are there any research questions we are asking in this round?

Signup is email / mechanical mooc

not priming gender stereotypes

academic mindset / identity

do we make it a very low barrier of entry

we place a poll as a sticky at the top of the discourse community

VMG: survey draft this week

I wanted to let you know how thankful I am for your course and just let you know that I am taking advantage of it. I am very much a novice, doing sound and recording for my church with just enough information to get the job done. Music has always played a huge part of my life, growing up around musicians and my husband and son both being talented musicians. I am far behind in the course because I am taking time to go over every piece of material thoroughly before moving on to the next, and it seems the other participants are far more knowledgeable than I, so I have been reluctant to share. Already this course has opened up a new world of 3 dimensional sound to me. Thank you for making it available.

**Subject:** **Grateful but late student**

Hi there,

I am taking this excellent course and wanted to express my appreciation to all who are contributing.

I started taking the course on the tail end of a move to a different state (thus, looking for work. etc) and have not had sufficient time to complete the requirements in time. I do spend time on it regularly but the technology piece (learning/playing with the tools) slows me down each time. I’m going to keep at it though because I am sincerely delighted by what you’re offering. I am a musician and even studied formally for 6 years but never had or took the opportunity to analyze popular music & artists. Pop music was so generally looked down upon by most of my teachers that I never even considered it-and I’m finding 

it a pure joy.

Thanks again & cheers,

Cliff Berrien

 Learning Style

When learning something new, what's your first instinct?

I try it out.I think it through.I discuss it with someone else.

 Your Experience

I've never written a program before.I've written "Hello World" or a simple app.I've built a sophisticated app. It was pretty sweet.
