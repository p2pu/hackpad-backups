# P2PU Community Call Calendar

Notes: Calls now take place on Tuesdays at 11am EDT / 4pm GMT

Process: 

*   Guest are confirmed by the person who invited them, they're given details of the link, told about the recording / broadcast in a non-scary way.
*   Bekka sends reminders 1 week before, via blog / twitter / facebook with subject and name of guest (where appropriate).
*   Bekka updates calendar event (in the p2pu.org shared calendar) to reflect hangout link and topic
*   Bekka makes sure call is set up 10 min before the start, and checks all tech. 

*   suggestion: someone writes up 5-6 quick bullet points/takeaways from the discussion and posts them to the blog. More narrative/"how to" tone more than recap--make it useful. With a teaser for guest next week. 
*   Great idea. Depending on the guest, and the conversation we can also upload the videos (maybe after editing)
