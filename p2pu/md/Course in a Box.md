## Week 4 - Content

**Agenda**

What is content?

*   What content have you used in previously?
*   What do you see as content?
*   Are you planning on writing content yourself?
*   Do you know about existing content.

Adding content using GitHub pages

Getting feedback on content and sharing resources

Nique: working with [](http://freecodecamp.com)http://freecodecamp.com - online coding bootcamp

Representing [Gods of Mayhem](/Gods-of-Mayhem-and-me-DhtbB93M62J) (under development); create interactive content not ad focused but content oriented; focus on maintaining a healthy community evolution in a toxic gender biased industry

Please send inquiries to: info@godsofmayhem.com thank you !

Matt:  I'm creating my own content. It's based on the content that the students will use but tweaked to include the teacher perspective. For example, it will take the teacher through the same course work as the student but include assignments for leaving feedback on our Discourse community. 

Nique: Hello Matt and sorry for the delay in responding.  I'm <s>new to hackpad </s>getting better at [using hackpad](https://hackpad.com/How-to-use-Hackpad-mlZvEsJykI5) I have read and reread the above paragraph and my feedback is huh?  I would recommend working with a UI/UX and content creator because your site is dense and the logic a bit circular and unclear.  It's a bit of a sink or doggie paddle because you are drowning.  Here's a corporate example of your competition: [](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us//lcds-tool.aspx)https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us//lcds-tool.aspx

Normally, I'd say Microsoft was worse than most with navigation and usability.  Unfortunately, P2PU site is just as confusing.

For example: 

Core audience > Practitioners

People who build online courses (similar to the original P2PU course organizers) and organizations who are looking for a partner to develop showcase or research projects.

Could be broken up with a graphic depicting the two types of customer with a hyper-link to the appropriate text for which ever one you are looking to do instead of fishing out what you are not interested in reading.  A user should be able to **tl:dr **a page on your site and get the idea of its content in 3 - 5 maybe 10 seconds before they are going to leave it, unless its a homework assignment.  P2PU is written with assumption your audience is here to study and will give you 60 minutes to digest the content, critically think about it and respond.

You are writing for scholars but looking for commoners.

Does that make sense?

90% of your strategic plan is actually FAQ's
