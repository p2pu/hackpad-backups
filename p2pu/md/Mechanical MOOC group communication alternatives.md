# Mechanical MOOC group communication alternatives

## Discourse

+1 product is open source and can be hosted fairly easily by anyone

+1 good import/export functionality

+1 web interface works through API

-1 beta software (it doesn't run like beta software, but this is the shield the devs hide behind)

-1 no documentation about API

-1  hosting setup will need to absorb if things really scale, don't know at  what point things will break down with vertical scaling

**Questions**

*   Can we use categories to manage separate groups
*   Are we losing the "private place for group interaction"?

        *    It's possible to restrict categories to only be visible by certain groups

*   Can we add invited users to groups?

At the moment it is not possible to follow a topic: [](http://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-you-think-about-favorited-categories/6386)http://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-you-think-about-favorited-categories/6386

## Google+

+1 Mature platform used by many users

+1 Google handles hosting, etc

-1 API is restrictive - cannot create communities and invite people

-1 Difficult to get analytics

**Questions**

*   What is the data policy? Can we make discussions on G+ communities CC by SA?
