# Why Open? course planning

July 3 meeting...

<u>Old planning pad: </u>[](http://pad.p2pu.org/p/Why_open)<u>http://pad.p2pu.org/p/Why_open</u>

<u>old etherpad course pad</u>: [](http://pad.p2pu.org/p/Why_open_course_pad)http://pad.p2pu.org/p/Why_open_course_pad

**<u>New version of course:</u>** [](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/)https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/

**General ideas for the 2014 version of the course**

Maybe too much stuff to do during some weeks; narrow down the content to create more focus. people needed to be on the course 3 days a week--might be too much (twitter chat, group stuff, hangout, etc.)

Everyone blog on the same site; make it a requirement to participate (Jane's suggestion)

Or could **use Discourse only** and tag with course topic--may need to have a Google account or create separate discourse acct.

Course running on github: [](https://p2pu.github.io/social-learning-course/)https://p2pu.github.io/social-learning-course/

Possible **guest speakers** for some hangouts

-- could do just two hangouts maybe, each with guest speaker

-- Speaker ideas: [Bekka Kahn](/ep/profile/BT4g65BvPRV) 

-- Speaker ideas: Open Policy Network IOL Fellows? - if they'll be in place by then.

-- Speaker ideas: Heather Leson from OKF

Consider taking out **Twitter chats** b/c not much participation overall

-- have one place for all the discussion to happen rather than spread out over different places

-- maybe have one or two Twitter chats in between hangouts

**Groups:** need a place for groups to collaborate/talk so they don't disappear

-- one of us can be assigned to each group and connect with them

-- Is it possible to encourage groups to be industry/interest related as opposed to timezone compatible? [christina] Sure, why not? People may not work together synchronously anyway, and they might be more likely to find use out of the group projects if they're working with others who have similar interests/careers.

Encourage people to join with a buddy that they'll do the course with

**Final project:** make it be something you work on throughout the course and submit it towards the end

-- make it like a portfolio of all the work you've done over the course; submit the last week and we give badges after that

**Badges:** Do we want to keep the same badges we had for the same activities? Or change it up a bit?

Create a standalone version of this course for IOL fellows and others to take later?

**Timing**

Aug 11- Sept. 5 (Sunday deadline for final project)

-- four weeks, including final project

Marketing the course

-- start around July 10

**To Do list**

<u>Course page</u>--Simeon will start working on these--send update by July 6

<s>-- clone the course (any organizer can do it), change all the dates--Jane</s>

<s>-- change info about communications tools used, how long the course is going to be</s>

<s>-- final project changed to portfolio and badge available--mention this in "about" page</s>

<s>-- mostly fix the course "about" page--Simeon will review this</s> and Jane will help

<u>Blog post/social media post</u>--Christina and [Jane Park](/ep/profile/CHxcA3vxBIl) 

<u>Invite speakers for hangouts</u>--Everyone think of people we might invite--Christina will work on this

<u>Badges</u>: consider whether we want the same badges for same activities or something different--Christina will think about this

<u>Set up Discourse for our course</u>: Jane will look into setting that up

Pre-populate Discourse

<u>Some sort of "pad" to use during the course</u>

Hackpad: can organize all the pads related to the course into a group--Christina can look into this

**Schedules (When you're away)**

*   Simeon Oriko - 14th to 19th July
*   Jane - kind of out of commission until the 15th
*   Christina July 5 through July 27, then July 30 through Aug. 3, then Aug 14-23 (but still able to do things with the course during those times b/c will have wifi)
*   Jeannette - Sept 2 until end (basically, I won't be able to do the last week of the course)

**Christina's notes taken at the end of the last course, ideas for this time.**

Few used the discussion board, even in first week. Don't know why. 

Count on only some of those who register actually starting the course. 

Have list of ppl to ask questions, like how to set up blog. Written instructions not enough for some--if struggle, may just give up. 

Setting up blog too much? Maybe just post to group blog and have tutorial hangout on how to do that? Set up blog if longer course & can talk about how to do so. 

Not many ppl commented on each others' blogs. This is a skill it takes time to learn.  

Too much to ask to put ppl into groups of strangers & ask to work together? At least maybe give them collab doc to work on? Maybe have a facilitator join the emails so can help organise ppl, rather than hoping one of the participants takes the lead?

Make it clear up front that the learning will be p2p rather than from experts. Or have a couple of experts giving presentations? Many ppl may not be used to this style of learning and may not expect this. 

Too distributed between p2pu, blog hub/links/twitter archive, course pad. Move from p2pu to WP site? 

Get participants' social media info at beginning so can contact them that way too --not too many emails. Only if they want, of course. 

Maybe start collaborative docs right away--what is open & why open

Jeanette: have a discussion at the beginning about expectations of the course, what kind of pedagogy we're using and why
