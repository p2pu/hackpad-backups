Hi [Dixie](/ep/profile/F2oODEtaN6F) & Guy

Heya everyone. :)

Hi all -- greetings from Galway :)

Welcome all to Reflection week

hi all

Hi all!

What questions did you use to help you reflect?

When reflecting openly (via blogging) I've been surprised and sometimes overwhelmed by the diversity of people and opinions I've been able to connect with... I've learned about others doing similar research, found resources I never would have found, etc. 

Like that idea of structure (who was that speaking?)...

Yes  - it was [Eleanor MacFarlane](/ep/profile/GUkzGLXfKHi).

thanks!

A conscious decision to use different tools for reflection -- both structured and unstructured -- would help?

Reflection can be done individually or in groups, I believe. The main think in my understanding is to have plan an action in advance, no reflecting before having planed some action!

Yes in the OER HUB team we try and reflect as a team on a regular basis, but its also important to get individual thoughts

For me, personal reflection in the open is a way of moving from the individual to a wider discussion and, as Eleanor just beautifully said "critical conversation".

Hi Bea! :) Yes... I agree Bea. It's a movement through different phases and levels of understanding of openness. It's very personal.

How do you get to "openness is a state of mind"?

In my experience -- in reflecting on my own practice and observing others -- those who self-identify as "open educators", "open scholars", etc., this comes after a period of adopting open practices to a greater and greater degree over time. It's not binary open/closed... it's a continuum. 

which in turn builds your confidence to carry on and become more open

Think it's important to find a way to feed back your research into the area you are investigating - to contribute

Have you used any other tools apart from Blogging to reflect?

For shorter-form reflection, I sometimes use Google+ and Flickr... even Instagram... I find social media tools like this enable me to share visual artefacts (photos, sketchnotes, etc.) along with a brief reflection. This is a useful way for me to record thoughts that I can go back to again, and -again- often prompts discussion with others! What tools do other use?

I agree I like visual reflection - currently experimenting with sketchnotes and yes [Mariano ](/ep/profile/Daz3aXt1rDA) i agree mindmaps very helpful for me - I like to thhink in coloured blobs well I try ! ) 

Mindmaps anyone?

[Deborah Baff](/ep/profile/zkAl3ejQYpS) and [Mariano Rico](/ep/profile/Daz3aXt1rDA) ... how do you share your sketchnotes & mind maps. just wondering!  [Catherine Cronin](/ep/profile/sFvlLzT4WfE) ive been mostly saving them as a jpg and sharing on twitter ! always worried they are not good enough for public consumption though ! Sometimes it feels more personal to share sketch notes instead of words for me - from the heart maybe ? but maybe thats just me ...

[Deborah Baff](/ep/profile/zkAl3ejQYpS) great point -- and I can relate to this. Anything beyond text is richer, in some way, and we do not typically have much practice in sharing these . It does feel more personal... to me as well. I had to overcome my resistance to sharing those, and seeing the "raw" and personal work of others helped to embolden me :) yes I agree [Catherine Cronin](/ep/profile/sFvlLzT4WfE) i was definitely encouraged to share by others reactions and seeing others ...

I would like to know the secrets mind you in terms of how on earth people find all those extra hours in the day to blog, tweet , instagram etc.... someone is stealing my hours ! ... 

safe environment - good point - leap of faith and exposure of your inner most thoughts ... openness is for me a way of life ... 

I use Cmap. You can put your mindmaps in the open... their server

:) :) I know the feeling! I am intermittent in all of my social media interactions, but I know that others perceive my contribution as more than that. Interesting difference! Also, I think we've hit on something critical there re: openness... that leap of faith, the confidence gained by seeing others (just like us!) who share openly, this builds confidence and -- for me -- has enriched my work and my enjoyment of it :) definitely [Catherine Cronin](/ep/profile/sFvlLzT4WfE) I do agree wholeheartedly with this ... particularly for taking that deep breath of ...this is me... these are my thoughts ...please be nice to me !

and to be fair I've yet to meet anyone in the open world that hasnt been nice to me yet ...maybe its just a perception that people wont be supportive .... 

yes good point .... deep breath take a risk ...

[Deborah Baff](/ep/profile/zkAl3ejQYpS) well said :)

yes I dont have established reputation ( well a research one ! ) I am a complete newbie ... all thoughts very welcome !

How do you build a reputation in the first place?

I suggest it's through sharing your work and networking. Comment on others' blogs, build your PLN through blog discussions and perhaps Twitter... but mostly just share your work, share your research, share what you are teaching your students.

yes agree - I do try to comment on blogs as I feel that it would be nicefor people to realise that someone is reading !  Ithink again this takes a leap of faith particularly if you are commenting on a blog of someone that is very well known and you are a 'newbie' ...

Marianno - if you laugh , the sound / camera comes to you .....  (not to stop you being happy) :-)

haha <<laughing quietly !>> in starbucks people think I am a bit strange now ...

hahah Laughing in my head !

:)

Definitely has helped me reflect ! and make connections ... I hope to do some research on the sMOOC we are running in Wales looking at attitudes etc so I'm hoping that this will help me going forward ... my only concern is that I have found it difficult to do as much with the course as I wanted to time wise - will it still be open for us to go back through some of the stuff etc ? 

:)

Really enjoying this session... video contributions (thank you all!) and here in the hackpad. useful to think through these ideas with you all...

criticism means someone is listening to your ideas - its better than being ignored!

[Eleanor MacFarlane](/ep/profile/GUkzGLXfKHi) I would love to read your blog :)
