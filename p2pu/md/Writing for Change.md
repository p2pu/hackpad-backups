                        *   _Not sure if P2P is the place to do it since a lot of that happens face-to-face at CU, but if we wanted to, I think it would be helpful to focus a module around consolidating the knowledge we have accrued so far, maybe just a check in piece asking people to recap and note some trends either in their work or another person’s?_

        *   We, online learners, define what we want from online learning--->what we want from online learning spaces

## Project Description:

A course where you'll team up with folks from P2PU and College Unbound ecosystem to identify your social problem, evaluate funding partners, draft your grant proposal, learn from others doing similarly-minded projects, and gain support within the social entrepreneurship community. Affinity groups (within Discourse, like so [](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/categories))[http://thepeople.p2pu.org/categories](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/categories)) will be formed around subjects/social problems. Ideas:

*   Animals
*   Bullying + Violence
*   Disasters
*   Discrimination
*   Education
*   Environment
*   Health
*   Homelessness + Poverty
*   Sex + Relationships 

We'll seed the affinity groups with sample projects to help people brainstorm ideas. Learners from other social innovation hubs will meet face-to-face but also find support through the wider "Writing for Change" ecosystem. Grant proposals would be written using the "jigsaw" method of creation, where individuals break off pieces and contribute to the whole in that way.

The *real* experiment will focus on peer review of others' grant applications. After forming initial cohorts around interests, we'd shift the focus of grouping into *where* learners were at in the process, or even which finders there were applying to. 

(This takes what we've learned from PWYM given families to families of choice to the next level). 

The bent of the community discourse would be collaborative instead of competitive, even in the face of applying for similar grants. (See Alfie Kohn's work on collaboration in the workforce)

During peer review, folks would deliver red-yellow-green feedback, but also toggle what elements in the proposal were missing/needed further evidence (real-world examples, budgets, other strategic partners, etc). They would then be asked to revise their own grants.

The goal here would be to help learners feel as "close" to as many other learners as possible. Hypothesis being that a sense of community is scalable if we think of it in terms of subcommunities that emerge and reform. 

Success would be gauged on a.) learner satisfaction b.) feeling part of a community and c.) funding success. We'd conjecture that 1 month after the course ends, the community continues to be active at 50% rate during the course.

Letter for Contributors:

Hi world-changer,

Adam Bush (College Unbound) and [Vanessa Gennarelli](/ep/profile/Cw53PwvRgVD) (P2PU) are putting together a totally righteous course on writing for change. The free and open course will help learners identify a social issue they can impact, scope a potential solution, and write a project that will create an intervention in that field--a grant proposal, an editorial, an Mission & Vision & Values & Goals statement, etc. We bet you get the idea :)

Because you are likely friends with one or both of us, we're picking on your for help.  (Optional!)

We're writing to see if you'd be interested/able to write a quick 1-2 page reflection of how you decided what your work would be-- in the class we're calling it your "Story of How."  In other words, how did you decide which format your work would take? How did you scope it? Who did you talk to? What research did you do?  

There's no set format for this.  And if you have a previous (and free/open to the public for download) piece you've written that tells this story, we'd happily share that.  Because this is a "writing course" we're looking for written reflections primarily-- but certainly wouldn't turn down other media.

Your piece will be licensed CC-BY-SA (vivre le open web) which means attributed to you, gratefully appreciated by us, and much welcomed by a new crew of social changemakers coming through the P2PU + College Unbound "gates."

And while the first iteration of this course will be taught with College Unbound students in mind, if you'd like to facilitate or take this course in the near future, we'd love to have you be a part of this learning community.

Please respond with yes! You'd love to contribute! Or no, sadly you can't. It's ok--we still like you. 

If we could have a few paragraphs from you by **July 15**, that would be delightful.

Lots of interesting things going on at CU and P2PU in general we're excited to share too (so be in touch!)!

Rhetoric of Radicals--handbook for 21st century activitsts--what kinds of writing could be happening

This is writing for social change

(Need to do a search)-- found on scribd:

*

[](http://www.scribd.com/doc/46387006/Rhetoric-for-Radicals)http://www.scribd.com/doc/46387006/Rhetoric-for-Radicals

Asking people who are in that field--asking people to write short essays about what it means to be in that field

Could you write a two-pager about writing and social change

Mix of personal reflection and technique

8 week course--starts in the fall (end of August)

Can get it evaluated by faculty in the university and pre-assessed for credit 

CCAP (Connecticut Assessment Program)

Will pre-assess syllabus that are interested in teaching

Learning outcomes and assessment metrics

Use badges--credit bearing

8 real work done--and always see the finish line

Framework: What problem do you want to solve? Who is affected by it? How is your audience defined how do you appeal to them?

Past [Adam Bush](/ep/profile/H8zvUWkhNgD) writing syllabi stuff:

none of them right for this, but maybe good starting points/lesson plans that we can draw from

overall-- excited to build a new syllabus out of the outline [Vanessa Gennarelli](/ep/profile/Cw53PwvRgVD) made above

**Project Needs & Timeline:**

*   Learning content (P2PU + partner) (May-June 2014)
*   Community design: peer interactions and feedback mechanisms (P2PU + partner) (May-June 2014)
*   Marketing: (P2PU)

**Operations & Wrangling**

*   Partnering to design this course that will be on P2PU

        *   credentialing may happen, not for first round: after the course happens once or twice-->bonus that comes out of this. Doesn't have to be ready in August.
    *   Could be retroactive for 2 years, forward for 5 years

*   Timing: start before semester is good, don't start 1st week of Sept.  / August 1
*   Timeframe & Milestones

        *   summer, time at start, time at end

*   Deliverables

        *   Syllabus (course outline): 50/50 P2PU/CU

                *   xx hrs over xx weeks
        *   allows marketing and landing page 

        *   Course Development:

                *   50/50 P2pU/CU - CU may be Adam + some time from other CU staff and students
        *   This particular course never taught previously: build from scratch
        *   but can leverage components of previous courses
        *   Readings, assignments, etc
        *   Crowdsourcing / personal essays
        *   Interactions

        *   tech: Discourse & badges (to ensure Prof of Record stuff for possible credit)

        *   PR

                *   Press release / edutinkering press outlets / center for social innovation
        *   Grassroots community organizations--current students or potential students

                        *   Entry point to get people excited about going to back to college

                *   Office of Higher Ed in Rhode Island
        *   VP of Lumina?

        *   course delivery/facilitation (not a firm view)

                *   facilitation: uncertain - could be light, medium, heavy

                        *   assignments: find someone who reads grants on education / find a local person at  a newspaper 
            *   built into requirements

                *   tech support:  P2PU (Dirk and Erika)
        *   learning support: P2PU *and* CU? (Mix)

        *   follow-up:

                *   research: P2PU--we'll finagle 
        *   write-up: P2PU + CU?--drive the write up
        *   round 2: support/transition CU (mostly) + P2PU

                        *   CU vision: setup so anyone could take the course at any time - unfaciliateted/auto-facilitated / self-forming groups
            *   Noting if credit-bearing might be more structure

*   Budget
*   Time per week
*   Sustainability

_Collaborative Writing Studio – writing as a core skill for lifelong learning_

Writing is one of the core skills any learner needs to succeed. Yet, online courses that enable students to develop a passion for writing, and hone their writing skills are still scarce. This course also provides a model for project-based learning with peer-critique that is applicable to the humanities more broadly, beyond just writing.

## Tech Needs and Setup

*   Tech: Discourse set-up (P2PU) (June 2014)
*   Tech: landing page

        *   points to discourse, course content is hosted there. 
    *   signup is signup for mailing list and discourse

*   Tech: research instruments (from [Beck Pitt](/ep/profile/mfpQdO1ZS47))
*   Tech: mailing list set up
*   Tech: badges expert account set up

Problem Set: 

*   Cohorts and culture: we've yet to give learners a compelling reason to build their own culture. We try to accelerate cohesion with structure, but we want to try to do it with friction.
*   Feedback vacuum: learners in writing groups tend to want more feedback than give it to others. Writing groups on the web are a nut that hasn't been cracked. Several paid sites offer guaranteed feedback. 
*   Sustained engagement: we've made the claim that working together will sustain engagement in online environments, and we've seen it qualitatively but still an unanswered question.

Feedback from [Philipp](/ep/profile/yUEfaoK1a1N)

*   These people -- one of the reasons they don't succeed is because they feel like they don't belong--feel like impostors
*   Do they feel like less of impostors because they are part of the community
*   What does it mean that they are students? Identity of being a legitimate student
*   Go more into the social network stuff? Being connected to other people helps you get help? Pull vs. push
*   Argument doesn't connect back to the sense of community doesn't connect back to WHY that is important
*   Paper was a bit soft into *why* community helps learners be more successful. Just proving / proof of concept as opposed to results

Feedback from Bekka

*   Does internet activism count as activism? No, working on face-to-face stuff

Next steps:

*   Include crowdfunding? Will we be gauged by the success of there crowdfunding campaigns?

**Writing Project: Fiction Writing as Mystery ARG**

**Overview: **

Peer 2 Peer University was created as a social wrapper around existing OER. It has since evolved into an innovation hub that works with open communities to prototype new ways of deeper learning online. 

 Over the last year we have designed and offered a number of large online courses:

*   We worked with MIT OpenCourseWare, OpenStudy and Codecademy to offer “A Gentle Introduction to Python” ([](http://mechanicalmooc.org/))http://mechanicalmooc.org/) which attracted over 8,000 users, split across three rounds.
*   Together with the MIT Media Lab we created “Learning Creative Learning” ([](http://learn.media.mit.edu/))http://learn.media.mit.edu/) which promoted an activity-based approach to online learning to the 24,000 educators (teachers, parents, students) who signed up. 
*   With NYU we launched "Play With Your Music" ([](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/))http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/)[ ](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/)All)which grouped learners by musical taste to work through playful audio engineering projects collaboratively.

All of these experiments share design principles of creative learning and deeper learning, and an iterative approach to innovation that leverages existing technologies and enables rapid prototyping. 

We have a Hewlett-funded project for a collaborative writing course that leverages peer cohorts, open content, collaborative work and critique.

*   Notes from Call with Adam Bush, College Unbound

*   Who is your average student?  Why are they at College Unbound?

        *   2009: 8 different 18 years olds designed a learning/living community/ match them with internships
    *   1st college assignment was leading an oral history of their town
    *   Adults who have had traumatic experiences with higher education / isolated / only students of color / higher ed was not a safe place

*   What core competencies do they see as important to achieve at CU?

        *   Accredited-->general education reqs (English, etc)
    *   CU-->communication, collaboration, creativity, resilience (not content-dependent)
    *   Personal growth-->actionable work that you care about
    *   Students-->they want it as fast, quick and cheaply as possible

*   How is that different from the competencies you see as necessary to achieve?

        *   Curriculum they build their own
    *   Every student has a project / thing that drives them-->that thing has it's own curriculum
    *   A student never feels like "an assignment" or "a requirement"

*   Who needs to learn writing skills? What kind? Why?
*   Do students *want* to learn writing skills? [Philipp Schmidt](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi)

        *   Adam: No. A student should learn to do something out of a need that they are designing themselves. Learners don't want to learn writing for writing's sake.
    *   But that buts up against a university saying "you must learn writing"
    *   He gives options: grant writing, project description, starts different bits that students can assess where they want to go
    *   Failing through writing-->figuring out what kind of writing they want to do
    *   Always starts from the student, their project and their cause-->shared assessment

_Collaborative Writing Studio – writing as a core skill for lifelong learning_

Writing is one of the core skills any learner needs to succeed. Yet, online courses that enable students to develop a passion for writing, and hone their writing skills are still scarce. This course also provides a model for project-based learning with peer-critique that is applicable to the humanities more broadly, beyond just writing.

Problem Set: 

*   Cohorts and culture: we've yet to give learners a compelling reason to build their own culture. We try to accelerate cohesion with structure, but we want to try to do it with friction.
*   Feedback vacuum: learners in writing groups tend to want more feedback than give it to others. Writing groups on the web are a nut that hasn't been cracked. Several paid sites offer guaranteed feedback. 
*   Sustained engagement: we've made the claim that working together will sustain engagement in online environments, and we've seen it qualitatively but still an unanswered question.

Proposed Project:

*   Cohorts write a mystery / fiction narrative together. The course unfolds with open-ended mysterious prompts that groups design a narrative in response to.
*   Individuals work with the raw material to whittle away / revise their own version.
*   All groups have investment in the story, and close to the material, so it's easier to give feedback.
*   Facilitator / social learning design team as "course jester"--popping in with provocations.

Outcomes & Success Metrics:

*   Use these methods to attract a different audience for fiction-writing that has been underserved
*   Establish a studio critique model for the web that others can replicate
*   Create small cohesive communities that sustain the course & produce a final artifact collaboratively

**Project Needs & Timeline:**

*   Learning content: gameful content design (P2PU + partner) (May-June 2014)
*   Community design: peer interactions and feedback mechanisms (P2PU + partner) (May-June 2014)
*   Marketing: (tbd)
*   Tech: cohort grouping mechanism (P2PU) (June 2014)
*   Tech: landing page (P2PU) (June 2014)
*   Community Management and Support (P2PU + partner) (August-September 2014)
*   Research: documentation and analysis (P2PU + research partner) (October-December 2014)

From [Philipp Schmidt](/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi)

As you think this through - a few more questions for you to ponder > Does remix in writing work as well as in music? What is "raw material" in writing? What's the main motivation for designing this as an ARG? One downside is that ARGs require a lot of content / curriculum / interaction development. Not something that is easily replicable or scalable. How does NaNoWriMo get so many people to write? 

*   Individual goal-setting
*   Doesn't solve the problem of giving and getting feedback
*   What's the pitch to community college audience
*   Stylish academic writing
*   Someone is trying to become a better writer, mostly writing professionally-->sentence structure, paragraphs, etc
*   Making a big difference to someone who doesn't have that academic toolset
*   Tethered to an audience that needs help
*   Could be like a mechanical mooc-->automated court jester
*   One script--scalable to anyone going through once

        *   If we hit on a recipe that people really enjoy, then we can scale that up

*   How do we deal with people dropping out / feedback mechanisms etc
*   How to make relevant to someone's life?
*   Is it easier to not have to come up with the creative idea 100%?

Audience:

The ideas are so much faster than you can keep up

Misunderstanding with others online

Get tighter on the audience

Use cases - 

user profiles

Go back to the idea and test it against that audience

Mustard MOOC. I'll talk to Philipp next week. I'm laying out a draft plan for a fall/summer project building a condiment MOOC that, in addition to focusing heavily on the online community, could possibly turn into an enterprise producing condiments created by the course members. Like a tastier version of the paper the Rhizo14 community is making. If it goes through, I'd love to talk with you more about it for advice, and possibly get you involved in the jam session. pun very much intended.
