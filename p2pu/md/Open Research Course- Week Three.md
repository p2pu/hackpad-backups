# Open Research Course: Week Three 

**This Hackpad is for the Open Research course Week Three Hangout that will take place on Thursday 2 October 2014 between 15.00-16.00BST. If you are unable to participate in the Google Hangout on Air, you can watch the session and ask questions/participate using the Hackpad or tweet your contributions on the course hashtag [#openresearch](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23openresearch&via=QuwexKfTXlF) **

Just limbering up for 1500!

Join us on Twitter : Twitter hashtag: #openresearch 

On the group chat in the Hangout we are answer as Beck, however it is us, Nats & Bea

I posted to the forums that I like the idea of green open access because it might end up being more sustainable -- repositories that are field-wide might be better supported, have better longevity, the data might be cared for longer, etc. It also provides an opportunity for researchers publishing in odder or more closed journals to put their stuff somewhere that can be indexed and searched and actually read. Gold is a great idea when 1. researchers have the money to foot the bill, and 2. journals commit to maintaining the data/papers/information/metadata. Green makes it easier to implement standards as well. 

the hangout appears to 

have gone off air

I haven't lost the hangout yet...though we do seem to have lost OER. :)

sorry - dizzy darkhead chopped us off (me)

are you going to start it up again or will there be a new link?

apologies.. a new link will be given in order to record this 

As someone without an institutional link, open journals are much preferable to closed repositories.

What do you think to paying for your publications?

It's tricky because someone does have to pay, and part of the point of open access is that we don't want readers to have to pay. So then...who? It makes a lot of sense to pass the cost to the researchers, but that makes it difficult for researchers with fewer resources. So I'm not sure. I'm curious about what y'all have to say. 

Martin Weller publishes on his blog and twitter and he also publishes in the OU's own open access journal the 'Journal of interactive media in education'.

he does use his blog as a sounding board as he starts to write a book

Perhaps its also a conversation about how to monetise ideas and research?

there are some prestigious open journals but I suppose it depends on the field.  PlosOne springs to mind for science.

50% of Chris and Alison's book is on jime - I think it was about 6 chapters

I agree Sheila, blogging is definitely a way of experimenting and finding your voice

maybe universities need to wake up to the impact of academic blogging and its potential to spread ideas and research more widely

Agree [Anna Page](/ep/profile/qrsCnA9Nlws), 

Good Question - who makes the decision what is Green or Gold? or who should?

green or gold - I think it will be a mix for quite a while and it will take some time to settle - it depends on how much governments pay attention to it and decide to do something sensible to work out a better way than the uneasy mix we have at the moment

Is academic writing the same in open as in traditional? I get the sense that it is a little less formal

It is not acceptable if open publishing is some sort of second class - restricted to blogs and low rating open jounals

**Dixie N**

15:28

@Martin In my experience the writing is about the same; you're still being vetted through peer review, and peers tend to have standards...

**Guy Cowley**

15:29

How will institutions value open publishing - will it support tenure?

**Dixie N**

15:29

Depends on the journal. And the researcher. And the institution...

**Sheila MacNeill**

15:31

re tenure Guy, it as ever depends, However that my blogging really helped me get my current job

**Dixie N**

I think a good blog can do a lot for you, but a badly maintained one can do a lot of harm. (Just like any social media account.)

**Sheila MacNeill**

very true Dixie

I seem to recall there is a well regarded American academic who has now rejected traditional publishing routes. Perhaps it needs more esablished academics to have the conviction to only publish some key research in open access journals..or do we think this already happens (I don't know!)

do you agree - should we share everything?

it is a judgement call - you decide if something is worth sharing - which is what Sheila is saying.

What CC licence do you use?

I think the right answer depends heavily on what you're doing -- an artist might want to reserve different rights to their art than a scientist might want to reserve for their data. It's really case-dependent. 

True, which is why it becomes such a complicated subject.

If you share something on a CC licence, do you still feel in control of it?

Part of the point is to relinquish control though -- if you believe that open means making your stuff available to "remix" then you don't get to choose what people do... could be awesome, could be awful. But that's what they say about free speech -- means speech you don't like as well as speech you do. :)

I think you can say "you got it wrong" but they're under no obligation to correct or change (or annotate) it... It's a risk. But I think the reward is greater. 

Being Open - do the benefits out way the risks? (in your experience)

thanks

Thanks everyone for your great contributions, this was a really valuable session
