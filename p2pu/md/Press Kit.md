**<u>ABOUT P2PU</u>**

Peer 2 Peer University, Inc. (P2PU) is a grassroots open education initiative that champions learning outside of institutional walls using innovative, open, peer-driven design. Conducting research, building showcases and consulting on learning design, P2PU builds tools and methods for the open web, sharing our research and building courses with peer-2-peer pedagogy and community at their heart. 

*    this still makes us sound like a MOOC... would be good to sound better than MOOCs :).  Looked to our about page initially but didn't feel it captured us precisely enough  
*   It's great. Hush. 
*   Think "deed" sounds formal--I might say "We build tools and methods for the open web, sharing our research and building courses with peer-2-peer pedagogy, community, and spunk. 
*   In England (and possibly Australia too?) you cannot use the word spunk... [](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spunk)http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spunk  it might get us banned from google. But I  really like the "We build tools and methods" part. Just wondering if this section isn't a little light on the "learning: focus?

**HOW IT WORKS**

*   great question!!! Sourced from strategic plan core activities.  Query how well the below is actually reflected in our website (which is best record of our practice, for anyone reading our press kit then wanting to dig deeper]

We provide our community with everything they need to implement great open peer-to-peer learning projects:

*   We inform and inspire by sharing best practices, how-tos and reports. 
*   We document the best open software tools and how to use them. 
*   We run courses on open peer-to-peer learning.  
*   We build showcase courses with partners, to learn how to do open peer-to-peer learning better
*   We facilitate connections between researchers, and share research findings on the principles and methods of social learning in compelling ways.

**MISSION: **

Showing people how to combine open tools and open content with peer-to-peer pedagogy to bring connected learning to the web.

**VISION: **

Online, accessible, learning: for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything.

**TIMELINE**

*   would use this to tell a success story - we had clear values from the start, and at each step grew bigger / diversified / reached new level of success.  Have tried that below....  
*   Should reverse the order - so newest (hopefully splashiest!) stuff is at top.  
*   Insert more about non-course milestones (no. of students/courses not a great metric for us) - eg Philipp gets Shuttleworth fellowship? or other awards? Big press mentions? eg lifehacker / nyt mentions?
*   Have saved your original draft in offcuts section at bottom.
*   I say big press mentions, I'd include [Philipp Schmidt](/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi)'s move to the Media Lab, when we won the Hewlett grant, [Bekka Kahn](/ep/profile/BT4g65BvPRV) getting that stellar Open Coalition gig, also add the Open Badges Whitepaper, DML Grantees to build badge platform,
