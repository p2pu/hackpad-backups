## Call 4 April

schedule:

*   May-July want to approach sponsors, with some detailed flyer/something to pitch.  Need some visual design and 
*   1st week July - International FabLab meeting in Barclenoa: key people will be in one place - want to develop the content there - quasi-sprint - visual
*   August - is dead month in Spain (summer break; people won't be around)
*   September launch date [for IoT 1: 5 weeks then IoT2: 5 weeks, so overall Sep-Xmas, with 1-2 wk break ]

discussion:

*   C: is discourse a good option? Demanding on hardware?

        *   Dirk: best option we've tried - have also tried openstudy, disqus, email list small groups, our own commenting solution, google groups, google plus

*   good to do some build before July - ie not wait to start until northern summer
*   marketing to complete new people:  visual examples
*

next steps:

*   start work now on:

        *   launchpage - M/C will do
    *   MoU - Carl to do
    *   course infrastructure: M/C/Dirk to start building

*   launchpage - let's set up now.  with P2PU branding

        *   DNS: [](http://schoolofiot.org/)http://schoolofiot.org/
    *   PWYM is good example: [](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org)http://www.playwithyourmusic.org
    *   P2PU can advertise once live thru various channels - forums, twitter, mailing list, conferences etc.

*   paperwork 

        *   MoU between P2PU & IoT - high-level agreement onproject we're doing, 3 courses, 1st course without funding, 2nd two with funding on budget to be agreed, use our branding, publish open 
    *   MoU/sponsorship ag't between funders and P2PU/IoT, depending on what funders want. P2PU can assist when funders known.  Funders pay P2PU.
    *   then contractor agreements between P2PU and IoT - short 2-pages outlining M & C will work on the project and be paid $[x]
    *   then M/C invoice P2PU and we can pay by wire transfer into Europe

*   platform - we should advance - M&C will start building with Dirk

sponsorship:

*   Marc speaking to Intel next week
*   Marc speaking to Taiwanese factory association that makes maker hardware
*   envisaging different levels of sponsorship - funding, hardware, expertise etc - eg high level sponsor would give funding and get right to offer a course in the school (using school's philosophy and with input from school facilitators). So eg Intel could end up offering a course on Galileo. Courses would be open, peer-driven, according to the School (ie P2PU) ethos.
*   M/C working on sponsorship agreement - will get it to us for comment.  

Marc's questions from email:

* all the sponsorships can go through P2PU and then we can get our part from P2PU?

* do we need to sign anything "official" related with our collaboration with P2PU?

* can we publish the landing page with P2PU logo, etc?

## Call 28 Jan

Scope of call:  discuss specifics of what we could deliver working together, to assess way forward.

*   Vision for (and resourcing/timing implications of):

        *   content - 3 courses? role of partners?  

                *   Cesar: have been reviewing the 3 courses:

                        *   1st: analysis - get people enthused
            *   2nd: design-based - get partners in, get experts in, talking about the cutting edge
            *   3rd: hands-on, working with the fablab/maker spaces (if required) - noting offline access not a requirement: can still participate online-only

                *   aim to complete 1st course first, run/resource alone (as pilot), leverage for buyin for courses 2 & 3
        *   content for course 1 largely developed by M & C already (much would be peer-created - aim is to guide/facilitate).  Vision of wiki or similar output showcasing most interesting student work.  
        *   course presents a list of interesting projects/template projects - students can analyse selected projects, contribute to a wiki/UGC database analyses/understandings of thoes projects
        *   4 week course (4 lessons)

                        *   W1 - broad introduction to the area, the mission, the course, the learners
            *   W2-4 - focus on interesting IoT projects, problems, solutions - eg pick 1 project, look at diff aspects: connectivity, .... ,etc.  Each week, students present their own research on the device they've chosen, get feedback from peers. Then presenters introduce new content to enable expanding thinking, understanding.
            *   (maybe a 5th week for more discussion/presentation of results?)
            *   goal: students can look at project, identify the parts/problems involved and comprehend/explain the solution
            *   outcome: db of projects well documented and explained, by learners for leaners
            *   meant to be big overview of the IoT scene - learn the lingo, the big names/projects involved.

                *   What level of facilitation required?

                        *   TBC

                *   Process to finalise content for course 1:

                        *   C &M have time/availability this month to work on content
            *   want input from P2PU on learning design

                *   Target size?

                        *   P2PU has done small courses (10-200pax) and v large (5000+) - tho not all will participate/complete
            *   Given topic, may not expect v large (5000+) signups
            *   Affects tech and PR efforts mainly 
            *   Could pilot first course (small), then run it again (big), then run the second course? Think futher - may not be significant advantage in running 1st course multiple times before trialling 2nd course

        *   platforms and tech

                *   want launch/landing site, collaboration space, informal comms/community space, wiki tool for output
        *   could potentially do something reasonably easily/quickly, using existing P2PU tools

                        *   Music MOOC as example: Wordpress or Jekyll?
            *   Communications: could use email (easy/light), or a forum (eg disqus) or existing platform such as G+.  None of these require extensive development
            *   output wiki sounds like good and light-touch solution, using existing wiki tech
            *   C startup includes a microblogging platform that can be used for our content and/or the UGC, and/or the comms

        *   budgeting:

                *   good to get some investment:

                        *   will be lightweight but non-zero involvement from P2PU and M/C - good to get that time funded
            *   will likely be great for the maker community - grow the community, grow interest, grow connections

        *   progressing with potential partners - identifying them, onboarding, coordinating ongoing involvement

                *   Cesar: have been thinking potential partners/sponsors:

                        *   trad. companies in the space, corporate sponsor - eg CISCO?  
            *   individual donor? no specific thoughts
            *   mentors - inolvement in the course itself

                                *   eg Arduino? could be mentors in 2nd course for example
                *   Seed Studio? not super big but committed to fostering projects like this

                *   funders: sponsor with funding
        *   participators: mentors/guest presenters/(donators of devices?) - mostly needed in 2nd and 3rd courses 
        *   no involvement in course 1; use cousre 1 as advertising the bigger idea of School and get buy-in

        *   learning design (ties in with content - projects, assessment, etc)  

                *   C/M interested in experimenting with learning design - learning things re the learning
        *   want good collaboration
        *   want good results
        *   should ensure we're tlaking to learning design people: P2PU contribution welcome here

Conclusions: Resourcing and the way forward

Next steps:

*   budget (time, primarily, $$ for any other overheads)
*   draft verbose content outline

Marc

*   [theThings.io](http://thethings.io)  - social network for internet of things
*   IoT Meet-up community in Barcelona (600 people) and Munich (300 people)

Cesar:

*   Maker Space in Madrid
*   Digital fabrication to make connected objects
*   IoT community in Madrid (400 people)

Carl

*   Strategy for P2PU moving forward

Dirk

*   Tech awesomeness for P2PU
*   Interested in open hardware and making stuff
*   Connecting online learning + offline maker culture in ways that reinforce both

[Vanessa Gennarelli](/ep/profile/ufOl3tEe6YY) 

*   Learning lead at P2PU
*   Interviewing informal tech groups around the world
*   [](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/)http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/

P2PU State of Affairs

*   Old direction: we hosted courses and schools. But that's tough on a little team :)
*   New direction: tools + knowledge of social learning = launch interesting projects that answer a learning question (but not maintain them)
*   So internet of things == testing our new direction

The opportunity:

*   Introduce more people to "Internet of Things"
*   Help people learn more about it and getting them started
*   How can they make a device / something for themselves?

Discussion:

*   Connection online-offline: interesting idea; ppl come to maker space and can point them to online course for how to get started.  Eg we can offer online component, content and template for course, while local makerspace becomes local anchor for the community and runs the course(s) itself.  
*   Audience would be new ppl to makerspace, taught by ppl with high level of knowledge re the platform
*   cf current arrangements: all kinds of induction programs in maker spaces but can be quite diff, and quite niche - teach specific tech, only the local tech, or a particular aspect.  No generic, conceptual maker/IoT framework
*   cf existing aduino/maker tech tutorials/content available online - low-quality(?)  Opportunity for peer-driven learning? create new content/tuts/vids --> bootstrap better content & community
*   encouraging creation of new communities/spaces - seed creation of new spaces in living rooms
*   resourcing: what's the funding needed on this? how big we envisaging? what happens when 3000 ppl signup?

        *   P2PU to consider its available funding and time resources
    *   Cesar and Marc: 

                *   envisage 100-200 ppl initially.
        *   both have some time, Cesar has/can contribute content and badges 

        *   P2PU can help reach out to funders, otherwise have to find a way to make it part of existing funded projects
    *   need someone to speak on behalf of the maker spaces - the offline spaces.

*   timeframe:

        *   slides suggest starting Feb '14: indicative not critical, but good if coincide with other events. Lots of IoT conferences next year around the world.  
    *   eg June '14 (London), May '14 (San Fran, Solidcon.com)

*   learning questions? what are we going to learn about peer-driven, open learning? 

        *   hypothesis that connecting offline to online can extend ppl's learning.  Eg do intro / course one offline, thetn advance online; can do level-1 offline, level up online.
    *   what do ppl look like when trying to find community online?  eg is it use-case, style of learning, etc etc - what sustains communoity?  cf makerspace concern re drop-off in learners and mentors
    *   how does having offline community change how you engage online? ideas like network of local spaces at which you can go to learn the same online content... [replace signle campus uni with distributed network of spaces?]
    *   cf Cesar's experience with a networked learning experience that lacked an offline component.
    *   [a thought: philosophically should we only enter this project if aiming to take it to a point of 'and here's how to start a makerspace in your community'?  If not - if only aiming at communities with existing maker-space - is that a first-world/bigcity slant that doesn't sit well with our inclusive, open, community, values?]

Next steps

*   Talk about possible sources for funding - to pursue together.
*   Sync vs email what the project will look like?
*   Proposal for SOLID (SFO 21-22 May 2014) - [](http://solidcon.com/solid2014)http://solidcon.com/solid2014
*   Proposal for Thingscon (Berlin 2-3 May 2014)- [](http://thingscon.com)http://t[h](http://t)[i](http://th)[n](http://thi)[g](http://thin)[s](http://thing)[c](http://things)[o](http://thingsc)[n](http://thingsco)[.c](http://thingscon)[o](http://thingscon.c)[m](http://thingscon.co)

Problems this solves?

1.  Make maker spaces more friendly
2.  Help maker spaces with on-boarding program
3.  Online course that introduce people to maker spaces
4.  Offer an alternative technical education using maker spaces

Questions

*   Why P2PU? open, peer-learning, community?
*   What is required in the offline space? learners need a space? need a team in the same space? other resources?
*   How do we differentiate Internet of Things from Maker Culture? 
*   How does it relate to open hardware? 
*   are local meetups the core infrastructure of the current IoT community? (mentioned madrid, barcelona, munich)
*   What do people usually make in the workshops?
*   How are activities started?
*   How do you engage learners after the workshop is over?
*   Do people work in groups? How so?
*   What feedback do they get from you? From mentors? From each other?
*   What would the courses be about?
*   Do all participants speak English?
*   Who would do the IoT courses?
*   Does maker spaces need certain tools to participate?
