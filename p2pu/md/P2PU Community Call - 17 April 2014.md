**Some topics to think about for discussion:**

**adaptor's license vs underlying licence**

*   When you pick up an existing work, you're not changing the licence, only the bit you add into it. 
*   Nothing has changed with 4.0 - all the licences stipulate that you can only ever licence something that you have created. So you can only licence your adaptation, not the original.
*   You make changes to a work, you only ever licence your adaptation, it might look like "This original work, licensed by John Smith as CC-BY-SA, has been remixed into this new adaptation by me, Jane Park, and it's licensed as cc BY-SA
*   Question from Dirk: So does this mean that CC BY-SA is not the same as GPL, it's not viral, and a work that originated under BY-NC can be adapted and the remixed contribution can be licensed as BY-NC-SA
*   Example: If you pick up a map under CC BY, annotate it with a bunch of stuff and use BY-SA on it, and then find people using BY-SA-ND on it you can't complain. 
*   Problem when people don't attribute correctly, and downstream there is a problem when people try to figure out how to attribute materials. - see next topic

-** use in collections vs adaptations/derivatives - significance of downstream licensing**

*

**- best way to handle 'stacking' attributions in downstream use (re-reuse, re-re-reuse, etc)**

*   example of Google OPPIA, which requires contributors to the project to waive the attribution requirement of a CC BY SA licence, in order to avoid stacking.
*   CC legal team are working with project to figure out how to manage this, because waiving the attribution might mean that it's difficult to track the SA because there is no attribution. 

- latest thinking on CC-BY vs CC-BY-SA

**- option to elect to forgo attribution**

*   You can choose to have your name removed, and direct downstream users to remove your name 
*   More about attribution in certain publications / in some cases. But CC recommends that if people don't want any attribution EVER then you should use the public domain. 

**- licensing compatibility: progress report from CC?**

*   No compatible licences yet, but with 4.0 CC have included a clause which means that should the community decide that other licences are compatible, this will be something that is a possibility. 
*   Legal team are exploring this. 

**4.0 uptake/upgrade report backs**

4.0 was designed not to be ported, but there has been some pushback from regions who prefer the ported nature of the 3.0 licences becuase they have restrictions in their regions.

Also non-governmental orgs (like world bank) have shown a preference for the 3.0 versions. 

**Misc.**

*   "We are addicted to P2PU" [](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/p2pu-site-down-urgent/548/4?u=vanessa)[http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/p2pu-site-down-urgent/548/4?u=vanessa](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/p2pu-site-down-urgent/548/4?u=vanessa)

        *   I'm going to break the site more ofter - it's the only time we get good feedback

*   Recommended reading: Alex Hillman's Coworking Weekly: [](http://coworkingweekly.com/)[http://coworkingweekly.com/](http://coworkingweekly.com/)
*   "You might think on #3 that you should reduce the barrier to participation _so low_ that any anonymous users can just type words on the page and click "Submit". Trust me, you don't want this. You want a small, toddler-sized barrier -- having no barrier to registration at all means the bored and lazy people will inevitably overwhelm your site because they vastly outnumber everyone else.

**Connecting Our Discourse Communities**

*   how to disseminate best practices amongst all?

        *   pre-seeding the community
    *   choosing categories
    *   subcategories and cohorts
    *   moderation privs
    *   tagging & polling plugins

*   categories sort of keep us separate
*   what if each discourse community we create had a meta that defaulted to p2pu's discourse? if someone cares enough to post to meta, aren't they an edutinkerer?
