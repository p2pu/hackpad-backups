# Organisational change - advice

Per HR governance meeting 8/22/14, we have an Org consultant willing to give us some free assistance. We will invite her to next HR call to share some wisdom - eg 30min + questions.

Noting it's a short session I think we'll get most value from pithy insights on the fundamentals. Can we work out say top 2 topics we'd like her to talk about? Vote/add below:

*   Holding colleagues accountable (Carl: +1), (Dirk +1)
*   Managing/meeting deadlines [in a distributed org] (Carl +1)
*   giving feedback; _taking_ feedback
*   managing professional development in a small org (Dirk +1)
*   managing operational HR in a small org - leave, harassment, and other 'employee handbook' issues
*   how to do reward and recognition in a small org
*   how to connect in productive way in distributed team
*   Decision-making in lateral orgs - how do we know when to stop talking?
*

To be clear - these were all suggested topics in todays call; I propose we only ask for 2 to be addressed. Which 2 will give most immediately useful insights; which are most likely to  immediately change the way you work/think about the team?
