*   CC 4.0 upgrade

Site wrangling needed:

*   this is a simple shopping list of changes to implement with minimal commenting. happy to discuss logic behind any of these too but didn't want to clutter the workflow.
*

1) update footer of all domains:

Add the CC logo if not present (Same as on p2pu.org is fine)

Add/update text around the logo (eg as on [](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/))http://badges.p2pu.org/en/[)](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/to):

"Except where [otherwise noted](https://p2pu.org/en/pages/terms-of-use/), content on this site is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)"

2) update terms of use ([](https://p2pu.org/en/pages/terms-of-use/))https://p2pu.org/en/pages/terms-of-use/)

*   clause 1 (and above clause 1): change references to privacy policy/notice  to 'privacy guidelines' and fix hyperlink to privacy guidelines ([](https://p2pu.org/en/pages/privacy/))https://p2pu.org/en/pages/privacy/)

*   clause 2 (Trademarks): add a second sentence saying "Any material protected by a trademark is excluded from the CC BY-SA 4.0 license applying to this site.

*   clause 6.1 (User Content-Generally): 

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>to this:

*   _"Therefore, by submitting User Content to us, you hereby grant P2PU and its affiliates and every user of the P2PU service a license to your User Content under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License license available at _[](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)_http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode__ and any future versions of that license."_
</ul style="list-style: none;">

*

3) Special treatment for content originally published under CC 3.0:

*   **_either:_**
*   a) does all 3.0 content carry a date of upload? If so we can just indicate in terms of use that such stuff is 3.0 and only later stuff is 4.0. If not, ignore this suggestion.
**   b) maintain a CC BY-SA 3.0 footer on all pages with 3.0 content - but this won't work if such pages are a mix of old and new content, or of 3rd party 3.0 content and our own content (which we're upgrading to 4.0).  If so, ignore this suggestion.

*   c) email all users who have uploaded content (can we distinguish them from just 'all users'?) at least the following:

4) remove this page (but keep the content): [](https://p2pu.org/en/pages/license/)https://p2pu.org/en/pages/license/ 

*   currently accessible from eg footer of Community Picks page (Learn: Courses)
