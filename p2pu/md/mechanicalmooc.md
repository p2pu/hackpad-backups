# mechanicalmooc

## AGENDA

We are hanging out here: [](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/72cpivh5d71b009f8olflebc5o?pqs=1&authuser=1&hl=en)https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/72cpivh5d71b009f8olflebc5o?pqs=1&authuser=1&hl=en

*   What is the use-case for the Mechanical MOOC? (How can we test which one is the right one?)

        *   An experiment to show what's possible with open source and commodity software (e.g. happy to write up, abandon, move on)

                *   Questions/suggestions:

                        *   Problem: people keep signing up for it!
            *   How do we spin out communities that arose from running the MechMOOC

                                *   get more community involvement to run the course
                *   "headless" model
                *   What are to core part needed to keep in going wrt tech?

        *   A toolkit for us to quickly build and implement (once off) showcase projects (e.g. Music MOOC)

                *   Questions/suggestions:

                        *   Karen, MechMOOC didn't add much more than the email scheduling
            *   Vanessa - we had pain points with mailgun!! Analytics are challenging.

                                *   engagement in g+ vs email

        *   The "wordpress" for setting up and running a MOOC (anyone can set up a MechMOOC without our involvement) (e.g. more Python MOOCs)

                *   This is in line with the Open Learning Hub approach--we show recommendations for how grouping works, this is how you get started, make it easy for folks
        *   Questions/suggestions:

                        *   How is this different from all the other (non-P2PU) MOOCs running in WP/G+/etc?
            *   What is the strategic benefit to P2PU of hosting this make-a-MOOC platform? Aren't there already a lot of these springing up?

        *   Karen - What do we mean by "mechanical MOOC"? Self-running/automated? Multiple runs? Mailgun implementation? Create-your-own MOOC platform? Non-facilitated? Non-connectivist (primarily content/skill learning and self-guided?) Remix vs new content? Something else?

*   Do Mech MOOCs run once or multiple times? 
*   What is the sustainability strategy for Mech MOOCs?

        *   courses vs ongoing community

What worked well?

What didnâ€™t work well?

Where do we want to go from here?

[are there unanswered questions that mech MOOC is best tool for answering?]

[are we aiming for a mature product that gets used without P2PU input/staff time?]

*   Gentle Introduction to Python community - It feels like the community grew up, what now?
*   media releases, etc?

Karen to Dirk - Can I get access to mailgun so I can see open rates etc.?

Next step:

*   Think about sustainability plans
*   Test market for more general tool
*   Talk with Open Courseware Consortium
