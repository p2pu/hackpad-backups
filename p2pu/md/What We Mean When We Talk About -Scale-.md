# What We Mean When We Talk About "Scale"

*   I was in a wine bar with a friend and when she said "scale" i made a sour face. I'm allergic to the term.
*   But we care about networked learning experiences--which requires thinking about how knowledge spreads across the web
*   We've had 2 roundtables on scale and online learning
*   And it's usually a bad term, but it doesn't have to be--depends on where the desire for scale is top-down or emergent. Scale is actually about money, power and identity. 
*   Questions of ed tech "community" versus how educators are using technology to connect with each other

Problems with "scale"

- messaging of scale is antithetical to teachers being in control of their classrooms

-large tools/platforms: locked in, stymie teacher innovation, teacher investment and ownership

- ed tech/scale obsessed with high growth when teachers care about reliability and connecting to each other in meaningful ways

*   via Andrew: ed tech is looking to replicate gestures of social media--but that's short-sighted
*   discussion of "addictive" communities misses the point of lifelong learning, and usage is actually declining

But the values of VC/capitalism are at odds with the values of education

When we talk about scale, we need to talk about if it’s in the interest of the community it serves

Why does a community need to scale? Is it just to make the platform "work"? Is that in teacher's best interest?

Ways to consider scale that are GOOD for educational communities

*   build cohorts
*   emergent communities

NYU has taken an official stance commitment to individual department experimentation (as opposed to joining larger platforms)

• Subsidiarity. Technology-enhanced educational innovation is driven by

faculty and takes place within the framework of faculty governance at the

local level, including (but not limited to) curriculum review mechanisms

within individual departments and schools. Generally, this principle of

subsidiarity requires deference to local decision making.

• Experimentation. The University should encourage faculty in the schools

to experiment with methods and tools of technology-enhanced education.

This locally based experimentation can take place at multiple levels, both

within individual courses (credit-bearing and noncredit undergraduate and

graduate) and across programs. The primary goal of such experiments

should be to improve students’ learning outcomes. They may also provide

opportunities to address other goals noted in the introduction to this Report.2
