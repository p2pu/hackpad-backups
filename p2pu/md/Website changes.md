**List of pages affected by the changes to the BLOG navigation bar. **

<u>Blog deep links that are not in the BLOG nav bar anymore</u>

For many of these, I think we should still add a note at the top to let people know the content is outdated, and has a link to more relevant new content if there is any.

The other decision I took was to how to deal with comments. For many of them I closed the comment thread (you need to log into discus to do that). I recorded it for each page below.

Navigation Feedback:

Currently collapsed header looks like this on FF: [](http://i.imgur.com/CwRSlKC.png)http://i.imgur.com/CwRSlKC.png

Would like if it didn't use a sidebar, like this: [](http://i.imgur.com/58jIx9I.png)http://i.imgur.com/58jIx9I.png

*   How would publications look? Would blog be there or in "connect with us"?
*   Should "About" and "Our Philosophy" be the same page?
*   Should the A-level heads in the nav be clickable? Or just dropdown to the subnav options. Seems like there's some duplication....
*   Love the "Donate" Icon
*

"People" Feedback

*   :  I think we should slice our our team, our board, and our community.
*   Community (our main collaborators): Jane Park, [Laura Hilliger](/ep/profile/nlvfP9g4vB6), [Karen Fasimpaur](/ep/profile/DLMI53VY0pI), Internet of Things fellas, Alex Ruthmann, Natalie Rusk, Lucy Chambers, Adam Bush, Tim Gaudette, June Ahn, Mick Fuzz
*   Can we add contact info for individuals?
*   I think you should be "Pixel Queen" [Erika Pogorelc](/ep/profile/HgL1VSf8fsX): you do UX/UI, front-end wizardry, and tell me we shouldn't use a damn carousel.

June 6 2014:

Start work on:

*   <u>new navigation</u> implementing new nav: use the one below, implement on one site to start with (eg badges - a more complex one coz needs secondary nav)
*   <u>home page</u> - need to move away from Lernanta.  Need to update content to reflect new mission/strategy  
*   <u>track record</u> - generate something from [](https://docs.google.com/a/p2pu.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqcxDvb7BeFYdExxU2t5alpKUlRrRVJUM2RRY2lONVE&usp=gmail#gid=0)[https://docs.google.com/a/p2pu.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqcxDvb7BeFYdExxU2t5alpKUlRrRVJUM2RRY2lONVE&usp=gmail#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/a/p2pu.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqcxDvb7BeFYdExxU2t5alpKUlRrRVJUM2RRY2lONVE&usp=gmail#gid=0).  Get everyone drafting this.

*

*   what we can offer? make concrete points that folks can put their hands around instead of leaving it up to them to extrapolate ways we can help?

April 7 2014:

Aim: agree a version of the menu that we'd be happy to build - if not perfect, then at least good enough to be getting on with.  

My thought: reduce menu entries with a few new landing pages linking on to content

Below is 4 menus, with max of 3 entries each:

*   P2PU icon (homepage)
*   About:               

        *   About P2PU, Credits and thanks, Terms of use

                *   _'About' page links to about P2PU, our people, our philosophy_
        *   _'Terms of use' includes our own ToU, CC, and privacy_

*   Learning

        *   Our projects, How to build a course, Other resources

                *   _'Our projects'' includes/links to: What we work on'(ie strategy), Current and past projects, Want to work with us? _
        *   _Other resources... might be empty for now._

*   Publications

        *   Blog, Other publications, [reuse our content]pnav material

                *   _Other publications includes/links to: Lab Reports, Research, Data, Stories_ 
        *   _Reuse our content could be a page on ways to use our publications/get involved: the 'ask'_

*   Connect with us [or Get Involved]

        *   Get involved, Forums, Contact Us

*   [twitter, facebook, donate icons?]

There's stuff I'd like to see in top menu that this sacrifices ['want to work with us?', 'want to take a course?', 'donate']: I'd promote those to menu if people happy to go bigger.

We can think about unifying footer on all pages and move some links there as well e.g(Terms of use, philosophy,...). The 'donate' link is probably something that could be good, but not exactly sure if it is a topnav material, again we can do a lot with footer. Some footer examples: [](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/website-footers-1131597)http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/website-footers-1131597[ ](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/website-footers-1131597Let's)Let's think about that? Top navigation is really not 

-----------------

March 2014:

Bekka and Carl have been working on this, with advice from Erika (mistakes are ours not hers :)).  Been mapping existing content sitting on our domains (not all of it publicly accessible at present), finding duplicative or stale content, thinking about an integrated user experience, and in light of new strategy.

A proposal is below, for comment (and, if you don't stop us, imminent implementation)

History of our work (messy) in our [full content map](https://docs.google.com/a/p2pu.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiJ5HTWV0kHJdFpmZWN0djB4VnpiWTBfcmZhdnZaOFE&usp=drive_web#gid=2) .

Proposal:

1.  New universal nav menu, to replace current near-universal hidden nav pane
2.  Draft some new pages 
3.  Update currency of some existing pages
4.  Tweak homepage to reflect shifting emphasis

Key points:

*   truly universal nav menu needed (current one not everywhere)
*   change entries to match current strategy and existing content
*   no loss of content (very limited exceptions where completely stale) 
*   but shift of emphasis - make key stuff more easily discoverable, move secondary stuff to deeper links

**_<u>1. New universal navbar</u>_**

**Problems**: eg cons with current universal navpane: hidden = too subtle, not available on all pages, some duplication and some omission of key content -  details at our [full content map](https://docs.google.com/a/p2pu.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiJ5HTWV0kHJdFpmZWN0djB4VnpiWTBfcmZhdnZaOFE&usp=drive_web#gid=2))

**Proposal**: (discussed with Erika) Could have universal nav menu on top of every page.  Would retain secondary (domain-specific) navbar on domains that require it (currently, just badges (and help, until shuttered in near future)).

See eg [](http://linkedin.com)http://linkedin.com for (randomly selected) example of 2 layer nav bars. Note on scrolling 2° bar disappears and only 1° bar visible.  We could do similar, for domains requiring a 'local' nav bar (currellty just badges & help).

*   The course part also has a local nav, see: [](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/)https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/. Not a problem, just saying :) Oh, and info.p2pu.org also has a local nav atm.
*   Good point. Note table furthter below re 2° nav  bars
*   I like the second and third nav bar of [](https://webmaker.org/en-US/)https://webmaker.org/en-US/. The top one is similar to what we currently have.
*   Noted. like that example
*   Me too!

**_New primary nav menu_**

_Note many if not all of these need to be updated for currency reasons - ie reflect current language, thinking, practice.  Haven't noted it for each page individually._

_Note need to resolve old links properly once updated_

*   Hard to discuss in the table below. My main comment is to reduce the number of menu items.
