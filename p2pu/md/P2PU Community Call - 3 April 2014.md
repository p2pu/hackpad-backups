**Discussion:**

Peer Learning - what does it mean? Why do we believe in it? How do we do it?

We picked a name [x] years ago, we wrote a values statement [x] years ago - does it stil hold up? what's changed in our thinking? what have we learned?  what were we wrong on?

Preparatory reading: 

[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning yes, it's wikipedia, but it's a good starting point. And P2PU is name-checked. 

Vanessa:

*   People who create value by caring for each other (and projects and understandings)
*   Asking for help and learning from feedback
*   Finding your crew of like-minded folks but with diverse interests

[Philipp Schmidt](/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi) - been thinking a lot about it; some big dimensions:

*   does it work?

        *   is it always necessary? can sometime be a hindrance!
    *   academic research useful.  Eg Harvard study showing your ability to join study group is biggest predictor of success

*   when peers learn together they learn other things (soft skills--collaboration)    CR: ps I hate the 'soft skills / hard skills' distiction :) feels a bit cultural cringe :). Plus feel you can actually teach anything, we just choose not to teach certain things.)

        *   other topics of interest
    *   skills re learning, that they learn from each other, skills that we don't expressly teach elsewhere

June:

*   Peer learning not good for v simple solution spaces - cost of coordinating/implementing peer-learning outweights cost of doing it solo - eg simple informational tasks.  Those might be better suited to computer automated learning.  Other big problems might be better suited.

Vanessa: reiterating importance of self-direction

*   importance of feedback loops; fear of rejection ->  easier drop out.  Need that feedback skills well honed and enabled
*   gender issues - more women entering education ranks, greater difficulty in balancing education vs other roles

Phillip:

*

Q: are people more ready for peer learning now that they were a few years ago?
