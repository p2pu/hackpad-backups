*   Exploring new platform/tools options
*   Social Learning Course in the works
*   Will be looking for partners on a data/stats course in next few months 

        *   VMG working on project-spec
    *   Stock up against high school course / masters course
    *   Content area: rec from Lucy--public policy; P2PU collaborate with High Tech High - US High School with tech/new ed mandate - good collaborator and interested in more; we can introduce 

*   Developing fiction course

OKFN:

*   Update on badge - deliberation, choice, implementation and experience so far

        *   Badges: using badgekit + custom solution.
    *   P2PU may have some useful code for further development

*   Community communication update?

        *   Strategy: Michael getting proactive; want to understand how the community works and how to invigorate it; feels like clearer mandate now - (cf past where was unclear if ScoDa was about paid training, community project).  Now clear:

                *   Paid training - will come from OKFN, separate from ScoDa
        *   ScoDa - will be like the HUB - priority getting fellows off the ground.  We can't be everywhere but need a presence.  Fellows would be trainers primarily not community managers.  But want to build up network of local (in-country, possibly in-organisation) reps who can work with people.   Will get small stipend.  Experimetning with diff candidates - eg students, freelancer developers perhaps - issue is finding people with sufficient availability.  Fulltime workers probably wouldn't have enough time.
        *   Want to have community calls that do a lot more training the trainers (fellows) as regular series of calls (rather than generic comm calls we have now).  Considering openness/format now - broadcast, recording, closed to just facilitators... [P2pU: hoping open! Super interesting sounding agenda]
        *   P2PU: must share our agenda of community call topics - discussion here:[](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/were-thinking-about-how-to-reboot-the-community-call/442/4)http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/were-thinking-about-how-to-reboot-the-community-call/442/4  current working schedule here: [P2PU Community Call Guest list](/6I0ju2LD8Dt)

    *

*   Marketing strategies
*   Recognizing mentors--train the trainers

 Looking ahead - what's in the pipeline, anywhere we can help you? anywhere you can help us?

LC feedback from P2PU website: got impression P2PU using open badges or making ours compatible with open badges. [VMG: which is true - have been compatible with open badges since March **2013**]
