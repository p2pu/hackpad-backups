# Research with [June Ahn](/ep/profile/vBXudnijo9s)

**Proposal Outline**

*   **Description and approach.** What set of questions will be addressed? How will they be addressed? What are the methodological and theoretical approaches that the researchers will utilize?

*   Messaging the appeal of the badge to the learner.
*   Balance of supply/scarcity of badges and openness. Tension between big names / legit entities and the original goal of community-driven assessment. 
*   Our system works best when peers create badges to share with each other--but so far that's an edge case.
*   How to marry badges as pedagogical tool *and* credential.

*   School of Internet of Things is piloting a course with an online / offline component ([](http://schoolofiot.org/)[http://schoolofiot.org/](http://schoolofiot.org/) and [brief explanation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lsBfMTGPndFEJnH8DlIgTyPISqreXblE_BOHgVdYg5U/edit#slide=id.p))
*   The course will use P2PU tools to network face-to-face courses in makerspaces

*   **Related research. **Briefly summarize and explain how your proposal is going to build on previous work  (references section are not counted towards the page limit).

*   **Potential reach/whitepapers/knowledge exchange. **

SELECTION PROCESS AND CRITERIA

June 4, 2014

I was really inspired by June's ideas on the call yesterday: [Research with June Ahn](/76tPZ54aNjj)

And his new paper, which is totally stellar and insightful. 

I think considering the badge system in terms of an economy will actually help us figure out a few key bits. 

Key things we haven't figured out yet:

*   Messaging the appeal of the badge to the learner.
*   Balance of supply/scarcity of badges and openness. Tension between big names / legit entities and the original goal of community-driven assessment. 
*   Our system works best when peers create badges to share with each other--but so far that's an edge case.
*   How to marry badges as pedagogical tool *and* credential.

I think this grant could help us figure this out further. 

Here's an outline of an idea for us to riff on:

**   As a way to connect these face-to-face communities, learners could create 10 badges that outline the skills they hope to learn in the course
*   Learners from different spaces could trade their badges and finishing the course would mean collecting a certain set / collecting 10 badges from others
*   Gives learners a *reason* to give feedback to each other across cultures

We could also fold this into Carolina's internet activism course?

Pros:

*   Funding for a project we already have in the works (low stakes)
*   Innovating on alternative assessment / continuing thought leadership
*   Research design from the ground up
*   In keeping with peer assessment / community assessment

Cons:

*   Think a lot of the IoT stuff is in Spanish?
*   Would need to talk to the IoT folks (they are lovely, good good folks)
*   Some sig development

Also, I was quite taken with Martin Hawksey's Tech trump cards: [](http://jiscdesignstudio.pbworks.com/w/page/63225947/TechTrumps)http://jiscdesignstudio.pbworks.com/w/page/63225947/TechTrumps

Seems like the "playing card" model with the criteria on the front might be an interesting way to visualize / convey to an older audience?

I'll take these comments and put them in our pad to riff on further? I know June has a paper due today but I can work tomorrow and tomorrow evening (if we think this is a good idea).

*   Network analysis for PWYM (spoiler: sad) :-(

        *   Dirk: data we can easily get is solo actions; hard to get data on interactions / follow-on activity.  
    *   Vanessa - will reach out to Soundcloud to see what data they might be willing to share, with real academics :) 
    *   [Vanessa Gennarelli](/ep/profile/Cw53PwvRgVD) to do: be nice to SoundCloud

*   June's project / course

        *   Brian and June have $40k-->have to spend it or give it back to them
    *   Looking to do a culminating big-impact project
    *   Perhaps: more case studies of open infrastructure to facilitate different kinds of learning
    *   U. of Maryland--engaging low income communities, challenge that the community wants to solve together; want to avoid deficit model (here's what you're missing, let us give it to you), but address challenges the community identifies, cares about, connect them to the social resources/capital/etc they need to solve the problem.  Not create a course to solve a problem, but enable community to create the course that solves the problem
    *   Create a mini-course for folks in this group--open course to the wider community
    *   Hyperlocal--> invite the global to it
    *   Partners are local church and local school-->start a focus group-->create a course with them
    *   Once we have a framework of what the course would be, come over to P2PU
    *   P2PU current relevant work:

                *   'writing for social change' with College Unbound, (and hopefully with Center for Social innovation)

                        *   students choose a social issue they want to change and write a grant application to address that, in groups.  
            *   lots of content re identifying social issue, enabling how-to skills on addressing, etc.  Could be lots of content/structure to be re-purposed
            *   Tech build + learning design consult = P2PU

                *   social learning course - how-to do a peer-learning course online; should finish in next little while.

        *   P2PU could do tech build + pedagogy build
    *   P2pU to do draft budget/scope
    *   Timeframe is not urgent; need to allocate funds this summer, can do 

*   Microsoft Grant

        *   [](http://fuse.microsoft.com/research/award)http://fuse.microsoft.com/research/award
    *   Ideas

                *   Exploring mentorship aspect

                        *   Stack Overflow many : many, badges is 1 : 1
            *   [](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251175/stack-overflow-is-not-yet-a-vast-wasteland-a-history-of-moderator-tooling)http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251175/stack-overflow-is-not-yet-a-vast-wasteland-a-history-of-moderator-tooling

                *   Not interested in thin feedback, but thick feedback 
        *   Professional development / employer / badges grown up
        *   Focus on the messaging--we haven't cracked that
        *   Peer distributed recognition mechanism --> peer 2 peer alternative credentialing 

        *   June's take on the call:

                *   They care about the peer economy / sharing economy
        *   We'd need to frame proposal in terms of sharing economy
        *   A-ha! That's how peer economies *work*
        *   How do we motivate communities to engage in badging practice?

                        *   For P2PU: What are the big issues we need to overcome

                                *   how do we motivate people to engage in badging practice

                                        *   best P2PU implementations have been when people create badges to award each other.
                    *   Less successful overall when we create badges for people to 'win'
                    *   Iearning community should identify what they want to recognise in each others

                                *   users don't see value proposition in the badges

                *   Tension: big names make the badge more attractive, but competes with original goals of badges
        *   Way forward--developing close relationships? 
        *   Value proposition of airbnb has a clear transaction and a clear motivation, less clear with badging--why do peers create badges for each other
        *   June is headed to Disney World--collect pins on a sash, trade pins, give them a pin. Remembrance of relationship. 
        *   Economy of trade / relationships. I have a badge that I've made that means something. And we do something to exchange them.
        *   Why does someone do this? Because they are brainwashed by Disney. What's the motivation behind this?
        *   Because they affiliate with things: academic lineage and families / clans / crew
        *   Famous person would "bestow" upon you certain badges
        *   How could badging help the peer economy? Reputation management.  
        *   Everyone who has some extra brain CPU to donate? Leverage someone's wasted time / free time / to promote something big. Learning is SUCH a heavy investment opportunity. 
        *   Picked an area that doesn't have an established learning economy--not professional development, universities--say I wanted to learn how to make bread. But no set economy for how to learn that and be recognized for it. 

                        *   Find 3 awesome breadmakers to make 20 badges each
            *   Instead of writing a book or recipes, they create badge systems
            *   If we get together and teach each other what we've learned, we can trade badges--not monetary exchange, just a passion around niche area.
            *   Emotional-->shared experience, learning

                *   Is there anything in Badge stuff / disruption that isn't happening yet? why?
        *   think about: what people want out of transaction, why they exchange money for stuff; why in our case they do it for credentials.
        *   What other things do people value? We know a lot about money and reputation....

*   Badges paper
