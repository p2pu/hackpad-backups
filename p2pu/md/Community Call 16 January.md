**Agenda for discussion**

1.  School of Webmaking (school of Webcraft 2.0):

*   good discussion with Mozilla on Jan 14: see [Webcraft Plan](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/s8APUoiSIKt).
*   Moz appetite for fully featured, facilitated school a la SoO

        *   build on peer-learning expertise from P2PU
    *   grow existing SoW challenges (begginer-level) into intermediate (+ advanced?) content
    *   their primary audience is existing Mozilla 'mentors' (people with some engagement/training already in webcraft/Mozilla-ness) but open to including total beginners 
    *   Lernanta being sunsetted in favour of other tools not an obstacle

*   funding - TBD, based on likely scope of work
*   could be good testbed for:

        *   new tools (github pages? etc)
    *   developing 'course-in-a-box' / 'school-in-a-box' guide/product

*   strategic fit:

        *   delivers courses on online learning
    *   deliver expertise/how-tos: we should produce course-in-box/school-in-box guides from this (fund internally not from Moz?)
    *   could be showcase, if new tools/ideas we want to try - Github pages
    *   research questions to answer? Maybe in indiv courses, maybe not

*   risks

        *   just another tech consult - want to avoid this, ensure are contributing pedagogy/design expertise, and generating new expertise (eg school-in-a-box product)
    *   resourcing - big project if done properly, perhaps worth making big part of the year if we will get lots out of it

2. Communications

*   Assessment Framework Scrollkit piece

        *   Where will it live 
    *   Unifying look and feel of these kinds of docs longterm
    *   Marketing plan for these--reach out to a few people beforehand?

*   Learning Creative Learning paper

        *   Reach out to our media outlets that covered it?

*   Guide / How-To publications 
*   What would these be / not be

        *   SoD example is more about looking at emulating content rather than design

                *   Distilling a lot of content from a lot of places into one document (which probably reflects a workflow)
        *   CAn be enriched with anything, objective is to keep all the stuff in one place. 
        *   Dirk: Need a peer-driven component

                        *   Carl: agreed but shouldn't preclude having some static content - our experience of what worked and didn't, not to be eternal but with currency and with updating/ongoing conversation

                *   Phillip: a guide is v useful as starting point, background.  We are one of the few groups who have spent sig time looking at this, thinking about the problems.  Should share our insights on what are the key issues to consider

*   How would they look
*   Where would they live
*   Move conersation to thepeople
**   Upcoming speaking / blog posts?
*   and please add to Trello WIP card: [](https://trello.com/c/dUy6cDqD/15-conferences-meetings-all-staff)https://trello.com/c/dUy6cDqD/15-conferences-meetings-all-staff  (Vanessa did hers!)
**   [Philipp Schmidt](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi): educon this weekend, Philadelphia
*   [Vanessa Gennarelli](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/profile/ufOl3tEe6YY): ordcamp next week in Chicago
*   [Erika Pogorelc](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/profile/oTNkHa0lFrI): OCW in April

3 Philipp (and Erika (and Dirk (and Carl) and Bekka)) would love to hear how everyone is using Trello (want to get better at it)

*   [Vanessa Gennarelli](/ep/profile/ufOl3tEe6YY) uses freckle and trello together (and loves it)

4 Topic for discussion: Companies without Managers

*   We had a discussion on [Discourse](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/excellent-article-about-working-without-managers/340/9)
*   What in the articles are things we like, but we are not currently doing
*   What can we change?
*   **Proposal** -> Personal office hours replace one-on-one talks
