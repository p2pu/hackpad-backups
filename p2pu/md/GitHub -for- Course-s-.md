# GitHub (for) Course(s)

-------------------

Why Github pages? Dirk and Carl discussing 8/19/14

Github pages: 

*   Therefore

--------------

There is an opportunity to leverage the collaborative tools that GitHub provides for collaboratively creating courses.

We are not first to think about this or execute: course fork & other platforms.

Sources of inspiration:

*   GitHub like experience for writers: [](https://draftin.com/)https://draftin.com/
*   Git for creating books: [](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook)https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook
*   Prose.io

Questions:

*   Currently we can leverage GitHub fairly well for collaboratively creating the content for the course. But is that really the difficult part of creating an online course? What are the difficult parts and how can we address that?

Git benefits

*   see what changed
*   compare different versions
*   allows editing by anyone
*   handle conflicts
*   allows review before merge
*   keeps track of history

GitHub benefits

*   Web UX
*   Hosting
*   API
*   Integration with other services (TravisCI)

GitHub disadvantages

*   Central platform controlled by commercial entity
*   Focus on Code
*   Lacks extra tools for learning

Other notes:

*   Mixing taking a course and creating a course. A true P2PU course should be a mix of having a framework, but the people taking the course also having the ability to shape the direction and content of the course. Practical example: Collaborative creation of a course is something we can do with GitHub, but what if people taking the course we're able to author certain parts of the course in the same way someone would collaboratively create the course?

## Things in the mix:

[](http://p2pu.github.io/jekyll-course-experiment/)[http://p2pu.github.io/jekyll-course-experiment/](http://p2pu.github.io/jekyll-course-experiment/)

Options:

1.  Combine and force 101 learners to fork the course 
2.  Combine and offer "optional" involvement with GH pages (requires learners to fork a course)
3.  Separate into a more static 101 and more technical 102 

**Community Design 101: Social learning course**

*   Anyone can participate--even those without technical chops
*   Cornerstone of our strategic plan
*   Technical expectations: markdown, 
*   it should be easy to participate even for non tech users

**Jekyll course template**

*   jekyll course template is one way to create courses
*   possible the primary way that we recommend
*   it should be easy to use in a basic way

**Jekyll course experiment, (P2PU Github Course)**

*   github course experiment
*   it's experimental
*   it's more technical (but you don't need to be a developer)

**The opportunity with the github course**

*   use the github course to develop materials for the social learning course
*   use the github course to further develop the jekyll course template
*   attract a more technical crowd and get them to learn something about peer learning

What needs to get done before we invite people

*   How to page needs updating or removing
*   Title

        *   P2PU Github Course
    *   n00p
    *   forky
    *   lurky
    *   purl (putting in a stitch) [](http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/purl-stitch)http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/purl-stitch
    *   fork-lightly +1 (or fork-lite)
    *   knit
    *   play with your course

*   DNS: to fit title purl.p2pu.org
*   Possible headlines

        *   get pulled into an open learning community about open learning
    *   put a stitch in the wider learning community
    *   bonus points for anyone who can knit us a badge

Use IFTTT to send automatic tweets to people when they sign up

If IFTTT can't do it, use travis CI to do it
