Last year's discussion

Hi all, we are just about to start broadcasting!

The link for the hangout is [](https://plus.google.com/events/c8iacr4j1vq4i869o44m0va882o)https://plus.google.com/events/c8iacr4j1vq4i869o44m0va882o

I'll be making some notes here as we go...  feel free to contribute, make notes, ask questions!

Background to the course: OER Research Hub has been working with P2Pu to look at the impact of OER on learning and teaching practices.  P2Pu are one of our many collaborators.  The idea behind the course is to capture and share experiences about open research practices.   Back in February 2014 we started thinking about the kinds of things we could include in a course like this and honed it down to a few key areas.  

how much do people outside academia know about openness and open research?

because not knowing enough about it can be a big barrier to participating in open research.

Hi, trying to log in to the hangout, but with no success. Listening is also difficult because my internet connection seems to be very slow. It appears that many others are also struggling. Can you see any of the comments coming through?

Yes, it's working a bit better now but we have had to invite people manually rather than them being able to join :(

If you're having trouble let me know here with your name

Still having trouble here, Laird.

Nohting changed for me either, Martin but just go on & I'll lurk

Hi Folks I can see people now and can access this and can see the twitter feed whoo hoo :)

You just need to go to [](https://plus.google.com/events/c8iacr4j1vq4i869o44m0va882o)https://plus.google.com/events/c8iacr4j1vq4i869o44m0va882o and click play - it works for me

technology doesn't always help open!

If you have intro, comment or question write it here and I will read it out for discussion

I have a question which I posted in the hackpad earlier in the midst of all the tech difficulties.

You did, I'm sorry to miss it

Will read it next

love it that Catherine's students have shared as soon as prompted and she has discovered some new ideas as a result.

Hi I'm Deb and I'm based at The University of South Wales. I am an OER / OEP Project Manager for an all Wales project called OERWales .... I'm working with Martin Weller and colleagues on the OER15 Conference and one of my tasks is to embed the use of OEP across the HE Sector in Wales ...all help gratefully received ! I'm also an OU student with 24 years experience of distance learning ... oh blimey I didnt realise it was that long until I just worked that out !

Heya everyone, I'm Heather (Dixie is how I show in Google). I'm a bioinformatician at Trinity College in Dublin, and I'm looking into ways to facilitate openness with my collaborators. I work on a variety of projects in a lot of different roles, and I'm hoping to be a better advocate for open research/data/access in the department. 

Hi all. Like Debs I'm doing the MA in Open & Distance Education, the interest here is that I'm seriously thinking about going onto to do a DEd so this is all useful background. I do a lot of work as an AL, mainly on the MSc systems thinking course

Hi Martin  H !! Yes I'm hoping to do some more studying research based in Open Ed now that we have got the MAODE out of the way :)

I'm particularly interested in that question because we have a big dissemination message to consider when trying to convince those outside academia that open research and practice is a very good thing.

Knowing about it is one thing, doing it is another. For my students who I direct to OER resources most are only able to commit so much time to study, however those who are looking at something work related normally tell me they have used Open learn though they wouldn't necessarily make the link with OER

Yes, people often don't realise they are using open resources when they use Youtube or OpenLearn resources in their teaching and learning.

I'm yet to find anyone in my circle outside HE that understands anything I am saying about what I do for a living in terms of Openness and OER ! Including me sometimes mind you !

so the challenge for us is to try and find ways to make open mainstream rather than niche.

Yes agree Anna :) Hello

Hello Deb!

Making open the 'default' position rather than closed (?)  but how ?

'Closed' nature of research is in many ways part of its validity basis... 

Excellent keynote at ALTC too Catherine 

Open Practice in secret ...

Thank you :) I don't think we need to convince anyone that open is the default position. It's simply a matter of recognising that it is the default in all informal, extra-institutional learning. That is the context of HE.

Yes agree - 

Rob, I think we don't exclude people if we explain clearly how to do ethical and robust research in the open, in fact if we do this well we reinforce good research practice and make it more transparent.

the trick is doing that 'how to' really well 

Hear, hear! 

Well said Catherine ...

Openness for me is definitely an ethos 

We are trying to establish an Open Educational Practice network of Champions across Wales ...

good luck - I guess we'll be doing the same with the OEPS project in Scotland, there are several great champions already who have done lots before the OEPS project came into being.

Thanks Anna .. will keep you posted 

in other words Catherine, it will take time and persistence to get the open message across to our peers who may not understand it or actively resist it.

Yes, Anna, I agree. This is why I find these discussion useful -- useful in articulating our ideas and different assumptions/understandings with one another -- very helpful when addressing concerns and/or resistance from peers and others. Looking forward to these few weeks in #openresearch ;)

Guy - I'm still here but unable to chat.  I'm interested as an individual with no institutional attachment in how Open Research can enable me to keep up with things like TESSA which interest me. Also how Open Research can better involve researchers/projects in the development countries.

Thanks for your comments. Their is an obvious beneficial interface between NGO work and development research which Open Research will support.

Thanks all!

thanks, I know how tricky the tech can be in a live hangout (oldsmooc experience), well done.

See you all next week! I hope literally as well as metaphoricaly

Post broadcast - this hackpad will stay live and we will check later! Please write any questions or follow-ups for next week below... 

Bye and thanks for persevering!

For next week - As I understand it, research ethics are much to do with the relationship between researchers and researched, permissions, use of data etc.  Clearly NGOs must accumulate a lot of project data which would be valuable for research, but they may not have requisite permissions.  Do researchers foster beneficial relationships with NGOs to enable research access to project data in the development education area? How sympathetic are NGOs to the idea of openness - or not? I suspect they may see themselves as constrained by their project sponsors/funders.

I'm not sure I can speak to an NGO perspective but there are certainly examples of where NGOs have made use of open data for crisis relief, etc.

Hi everyone, thanks so much for all your contributions. The recording of the Hangout is available here: [](http://tinyurl.com/lxyudvq)**http://tinyurl.com/lxyudvq**** **
