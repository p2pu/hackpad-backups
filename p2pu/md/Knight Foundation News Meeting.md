        *   Community colleges don't have enough rooms-->no capacity for basic education classes
    *   Combination of online classes (a lot of introduction bw student and teacher)-->but students were not motivated to continue-->a lot of drop out

*   Ricardo is developing a new college --> 

        *   Needs to study how peer meetups 

*   Ricardo's idea: location for tutoring

    *   Is there a cohort of students for next spring ---> or next fall

Agenda

*   Background P2PU
*   Ideas
*   Grant specifics / deliverables

Knight Application: 

*   From September 10 to September 30, weâ€™re inviting you to submit your idea to win a share of $2.5 million
*   Award in January of 2015
*   After submissions close, participants will have the opportunity to refine their submission during the feedback and refinement phases.

Idea: Peer support of adults taking an online course together

*   CPL: trying to figure out adult learning-->something that will help them in their careers
*   Tried acting like a coworking space--shared workspace in a library, but couldn't make it fit. coworking for people looking for jobs didn't fully make sense. 
*   Feels like the right role for libraries, but a role that nobody has figured out how to do
*   Career coaching services needed-->refer and introduce people 

*   Libraries can provide an information-rich/ knowledge-rich environment for people who are taking online courses

        *   Add a level of support and scaffolding that does not exist online

*   Andrea: The idea of learning all by myself in front of a computer screen isn't so compelling
*   Framing the opportunity/ need:

        *   Could tie to retention, which is an issue especially for those not already succeeding in education (MOOC "survivors" tend to have advanced degrees, not enough diversity)

*   Subject: unclear-->what are the courses that people want to take in library settings
*   Library successfully support online learning? Figure out what they are already doing online? Then being a connector bw libraries and online learning
*   Surveys and question-asking about what they want to learn

What's needed?

*   Space (many organizations already use the library without the library involving them)
*   Support?

Who would we target?

People already using library?

expanding user base?

Format?

*   We could design a 'course' like the rhizomatic learning course where everyone takes a course that interests them and our 'course' is a framework around meet-ups, maybe 'how-to' get the most out of MOOCs etc
*   Or like Philipp's State Dept solution - we curate a shortlist of interesting courses - group decides what they want to do, we provide support piece: Conversation recipes and scripts--that group gets a little bit of support
*   A way to promote the library through an online course

Homework:

*   Who are library users interested in online courses?
*   What courses are they interested in?
*   What do they need to be (more) successful? 

Host a regular meetup

*   Space - Reconfigure existing meeting spaces for peer-learning 
*   Calendar - Sign-up, keep track of who is coming, etc.

Human facilitators/ Support:

*   Social/ study habits
*   Content - Academic support--librarian could pull ressources
*   Technology (how to use the online course) - Librarian could support with digital literacy interventions
*   Introduce folks to online learning--people who don't know about online learning in the first place

        *   Low hanging fruit--people who are already taking online courses
    *   Further along--people who have *never* taken online courses (appeal to those) in the future, this will increase access to online learning in general
    *   Sketch out how we might use the library space in the future-->innovate on the space as well

*   Tie it to retention in these online communities
*   Promote
