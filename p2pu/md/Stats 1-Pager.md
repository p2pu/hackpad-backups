## A Creative Approach to Statistics

A working knowledge of statistics opens a lot of doors: careers in analytics, research, technology and marketing all require a fluency with data.  Even the Carnegie Foundation has identified Stats as a necessary 21st Century Skill ([](http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/resources/videos/introducing-statway/))http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/resources/videos/introducing-statway/[)](http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/resources/videos/introducing-statway/However).[ ](http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/resources/videos/introducing-statway/).However)However, your average Introduction to Statistics course could not be dryer. From hum-drum textbooks to bland videos to poorly-constructed problem sets, the current offerings out there do not help data "come alive" and sustain interest in this discipline. Which is a total bummer, and we can do better.

We're looking to craft a "P2PU approach" to Statistics. Our vision would depart from current offerings in the online learning space, and would take the following shape:

*   Approach stats as a 21st Century Skill. This course would take stats from the textbook to real life, with students creating real portfolios of their work that they can show to an employer. 
*   Create a community around stats and data. Learners would form small teams online where they would grow to trust each other. These affinity groups would give folks a place to go for help and a sense of safety. 
*   Move the goalpost of curiosity. Instead of exhausting interest through repetition and skill-and-drill, folks will "learn how to learn" through exploration, iteratively thinking bigger and taking on new challenges. 
*   Project-based + interest-driven. Learners would work with datasets that are relevant to their interests. They might identify one project at the beginning of the course and iterate through it each week.
*   Collaborative + feedback focused. Learners would show their work and help each other in a playful, relaxed way, present their projects to others and support each other.

In our "P2PU-ized" creative version, students will master the same skills as the traditional statistics course. We're confident we can surpass the typical 2-8% MOOC completion rate with this approach (we're aiming for closer to 50%).

## Where We Need Help

We're looking to partner with a <s>whip-smart </s>subject matter expert in statistics or data who shares our pedagogical approach. This person would consult with P2PU as we activate opencourseware with social learning design. More precisely we're looking for support with the following activities:

*   adapt Statistics 101 content for a playful online audience
*   research + provide open resources to bolster the learning experience (solutions manuals, collaborative whiteboards, nifty problem sets, etc).
*   review learner portfolios and project submissions for accuracy and provide feedback
*   work with P2PU research team to harvest data and produce final report

We're looking to dig in as soon as possible, with the course launching in late spring. We have funding available for your time, and expect we'd need you for 10-20 hours per week through to summer.
