# Data brainstorm

We had pitched running 2 stats courses with the objective of showing that using P2PU methodologies for learning subjects like stats has a valuable output. 

The people we have talked to were:

*   HTH
*

Vanessa: Civic Hacking: Local Impact

*   New America Foundation - we know a few ppl
*   [](http://hackforchange.org/)http://hackforchange.org/
*   [](https://18f.gsa.gov/)https://18f.gsa.gov/ - we know 2 ppl
*   [](https://medium.com/@georgiamoon/public-space-civic-engagement-and-the-internet-39f43b1e0c31)https://medium.com/@georgiamoon/public-space-civic-engagement-and-the-internet-39f43b1e0c31
*   **Public Lab (**[](http://publiclab.org))**http://publiclab.org)**** ** 
*   Bekka wikimedia network / open coalition? London based GLAMs? 

        *   Natural History Museum, Science Museum 

*   Laurenellen's thoughts on people to talk to?
*   CU want to do a playful module for one of their quant courses?
*   Dirk: Mech MOOC expansion / peerified version. Would get better than v1, would improve our tool, would allow internal comparison against a traditional MOOC. What will other stakeholders think?

Scaffolded civic hack? do you want to make change in your city, what data would you need, how to find it, how to use it, get it done. Even if not great for Mindsets could be good eg pitch to knight

Movements to use open data

Cybersecurity?

Other quant areas? Biology?, Science?, Astronomy? Sustainability.

Potential partners:

*   iflscience

Dirk: Open data feels a bit tired; lots of existing communities, lots of existing content and courses. Feel like we need to distinguish ourselves, maybe step on toes. So is there another traditional course we could target?

Bekka: Beatrice suggested an (advanced) Open Data idea; ethics, civics, implications of access to data, ubiquitous surveillance, data access and ownership, those kind of ideas.

Background - here's what we pitched to Hewlett in early 2013:

*   _Introduction to Data – An interest-driven approach to statistics_
*   Increasingly, active participation in culture and society requires some level of fluency with statistical methods. And data skills are in demand for jobs across almost all sectors of the economy. Using lessons we learned in the “Data Explorer Mission” we’ll approach the core course content--relationships in data, distribution, probability, and regression--by leading learners through a data project. Participants learn to articulate a question that can be answered with data, and are led through the steps towards answering it. We will use high quality OpenCourseWare materials as background resources, and also make use of engaging resources such as Stats with Cats ([](http://statswithcats.wordpress.com/))http://statswithcats.wordpress.com/) and Gary Ramseyer's Archives of Statistics Fun. (www.ilstu.edu/~gcramsey/FunArchives.html). The users final project will be a “Data Gallery” blog where learners can point to moments in the course, and examples in their project, when they mastered a particular concept. The course would tap into our partnership with the Open Knowledge Foundation and we could promote via our own School of Data.
