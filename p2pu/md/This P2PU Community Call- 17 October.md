That's confusing 

Strikes me as a super interesting focus > Getting universities and learning providers to share more of the data about learning, that they have. And then helping others to use that data / create feedback loops.

Actually - that's one of the things that would be most useful. Getting help with licensing education data.

**Carl Ruppin**

4:32 PM

Two things that resonate with recent P2P discussions: 1) E not R focus: per the okfn link above, this is about OE not OER per se; and 2) social/peer focus: need for a working group coz 'people were the missing link'

intrusting.

**me**

4:33 PM
