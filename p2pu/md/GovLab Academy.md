What's Possible 

**Agenda, Dec 16, 2013 **

Overview of Gov 3.0, Mehan 

*   1) Week by Week Themes

        *   Flexible Sequence (syllabus is like a "menu" that Beth chooses from)
    *   More than half of the classes had an outside expert (conference call, google hangout, with practitioners - experts brought real world experience) 

*   2) Idea --> Implementation  

        *   Final Product: 10 page proposal with a well defined problem, research on the problem, and a proposed solution  
    *   Think about the problem deeper and deeper. Refine it, send it to an outside expert to get feedback, what have other people done, what worked, and didn't work.

*   3) Skills 

        *   Goal: Teach the rudimentary skills to prototype 
    *   Goal: Assessing the skills students have and beginning to teach them about things

What's next for the students? 

*   Path 1) Take the work and take it into a production class 
*   Path 2) Connect with resources on their own, funding to build this outside of class

What the class is: 

*   Inspiration, pathway to a clearly defined proposal

What this class is not: 

*   It is not about teaching technology tools, not a lecture style class, not hands on training of the tech 

Ideas / Questions:  

*   One year fellows after the course
*   Summer fellowship 
*   Reading group

Online Component: 

*   To make this available in the same place, there is a huge opportunity for the material of the class. You did not need to be in the classroom for the lectures.
*   Caveat: There needs to be accountability for the project to show the progress of their project. 
*   Caveat: Working and collaborating with other students, but they didn't know what people's interests were. 
*   Skillshare Class at the beginning of the class.
*   How would you design on online seminar, which topic to choose?  

**Agenda, December 12, 2013**

Modules that are part of Gov3.0 curriculum (plug-and-play)

*   Each module is 2-3 weeks long
*   Question: Does that fit into Gov3.0 structure (or could the structure be changed to make it fit)

Start with 2 Topics:

*   Citizen Science: Modeled after Public Mapping Mission, with stronger public policy tie-in

Proof of concept: 

*   Project gallery
*   Mentorship

Ideas for a Two-Three week "module" (Based on current 3.0 syllabus):

*   Getting Better Expertise In: Big and Small Data  

        *   Collecting, Computing and Visualizing Data 
    *   Partner with CUSP 

*   Getting Better Expertise In: Crowdsourcing

        *   Crowdsource ideas for "x" 

*   Behavioral Insights Unit: Nudge Techniques 

        *   Partner with David Halpern 
    *   Learn about different case studies 
    *   Design your own experiment  

*   Small Data Unit 

        *   Partner with Deborah Estrin? 

*   Social Innovation (need to narrow scope) 

        *   Partner with NESTA? 

**Agenda, December 10, 2013 **

Closing out December: (2 min) 

*   Open Gov Stories

        *   17 Short Films, 1 Trailer, 4 - 8 How Casts, 17 full transcript  (Due Dec 18)
    *   Soft Launch - Before christmas break 
    *   Full Launch + Event - Jan 2013 

*   Public Mapping Mission 

        *   Blog posts 
    *   A prototype for other hybrid learning events. 

*   Meetings with Channel Partners

        *   Confirmed: Shelley on Dec 13 
    *   TBC: Felipe on Dec 12 or 13th 
    *   David Halpern, Philipp 

*   Filming Gov 3.0 Final Presentations 
*   Website 1.0 fixes

Next Steps: 

*   Clarify vision for taking Gov 3.0 Online 
*   Deciding partner universities and engagement with Knight cities 
*   Timeline 
*   Defining success for the next three months 

If I've left out more pressing issues, please do let me know. 

New Ideas:

1) Behavorial Insights -- Producing a film 

Big Picture:

1) Initial focus: Online Class 

2) 1.0 Materials for the mentoring program, for the code for america bridage

*   3) Code For America as an audience 

Dec 5, 2013

1) Trello and Erika 

First set of questions:

*   [](https://trello.com/c/I9dT8Tcc/15-displaying-data-about-the-organization-in-tsays)[https://trello.com/c/I9dT8Tcc/15-displaying-data-about-the-organization-in-t](https://trello.com/c/I9dT8Tcc/15-displaying-data-about-the-organization-in-the-footer)says to put up the data about the govlab, just to make things a bit quicker, could you put in the data that you want to display (at this point I would like to "warn" about exposing email address, because this can result in a whole lot of spam on that mailbox that we would be exposing).

*   [](https://trello.com/c/x0ZZPBZa/3-partnership-logos)[https://trello.com/c/x0ZZPBZa/3-partnership-logos](https://trello.com/c/x0ZZPBZa/3-partnership-logos)

Does this ticket lists all the partners that you want to publish or are there any more? (what exactly goes under MIT Learning, media lab or something else? I am asking this to find the right logos)

Comment added: I would use the Learning logo (unless Philipp thinks otherwise) 

*   [](https://trello.com/c/n213oquV/5-replacing-home-page-video)[https://trello.com/c/n213oquV/5-replacing-home-page-video](https://trello.com/c/n213oquV/5-replacing-home-page-video)

What was the answer to this question? And If I shall switch could you point me to the right one in order to avoid me making a mistake and cost time?

I am finding out for you right now. 

*   [](https://trello.com/c/2D5JWhZp/19-twitter-list)[https://trello.com/c/2D5JWhZp/19-twitter-list](https://trello.com/c/2D5JWhZp/19-twitter-list)

I would need a name of this group and a link to it

"Open Governance" 

[](https://twitter.com/TheGovLab/lists/open-governance)https://twitter.com/TheGovLab/lists/open-governance

*   [](https://trello.com/c/7SDUQvhs/4-opengov-stories-page-on-thegovlab-academy)[https://trello.com/c/7SDUQvhs/4-opengov-stories-page-on-thegovlab-academy](https://trello.com/c/7SDUQvhs/4-opengov-stories-page-on-thegovlab-academy)

I am not sure what this ticket is about. Could you explain a bit further, please.

*   I have a question about the blog page. There are two tickets, one says to want to recreate blogging section on the Academy site [](https://trello.com/c/OwndRopY/11-format-the-blog-post-titles-in-the-blog-rss-feed-differently)[https://trello.com/c/OwndRopY/11-format-the-blog-post-titles-in-the-blog-rss-feed-differently](https://trello.com/c/OwndRopY/11-format-the-blog-post-titles-in-the-blog-rss-feed-differently), the other is saying to make a blog page, which would receive a post every two weeks [](https://trello.com/c/FjddrnjZ/24-create-a-blog-page-we-would-upload-an-article-bi-weekly)[https://trello.com/c/FjddrnjZ/24-create-a-blog-page-we-would-upload-an-article-bi-weekly](https://trello.com/c/FjddrnjZ/24-create-a-blog-page-we-would-upload-an-article-bi-weekly).

*   I was wondering about Open Gov Stories page. Right now it has a flyer and a form on it. Is this all we want to show on this page?[ ](http://www.thegovlabacademy.org/open-gov-stories/)[](http://www.thegovlabacademy.org/open-gov-stories/)[http://www.thegovlabacademy.org/open-gov-stories/](http://www.thegovlabacademy.org/open-gov-stories/)[ ](http://www.thegovlabacademy.org/open-gov-stories/On)On the ticket on Trello you pasted the reference to for video thumbnails for "how casts". Are this "how casts" coming to this page? [](https://trello.com/c/7SDUQvhs/4-opengov-stories-page-on-thegovlab-academy)[https://trello.com/c/7SDUQvhs/4-opengov-stories-page-on-thegovlab-academy](https://trello.com/c/7SDUQvhs/4-opengov-stories-page-on-thegovlab-academy)

*   This is resolved - we are leaving it as is for now and will think about presenting the how casts

What is the solution we would like to go with: 

*   a blog academy's own blog page where posts would be published every two weeks
*   publish a link to the blog on govlab.com so the page will link there
*   make rss feed apear in main content as a blog (which will probably link to the govlab.org page eventualy)

 Since we are coming to the end of the spring and the trello board is almost empty there are final couple of things that we need to talk about:

*   [](https://trello.com/c/g7J2V81I/9-serving-all-the-videos-from-one-source)[https://trello.com/c/g7J2V81I/9-serving-all-the-videos-from-one-source](https://trello.com/c/g7J2V81I/9-serving-all-the-videos-from-one-source)

this card is doable, but there is one thing that I would need from you. If we will make a page where all videos will be combined, than I would need someone to go trough all the videos (I think it is about 80), and put them in a category (which I can deploy today). 

The one problem I have before being able to deploy this is that I would need to know all the categories that videos would go into (like with the NY Times example, which has a nice navigation on top based on video categories). In order for me to finish this until tomorrow this would be quite urgent (sorry for the late request), so if you consult the person who put in this request (I think it was Stefaan) and come up with a few categories to fit videos into (I guess one would be Big Data, another Crowdsourcing,...).

*   There is another card I am not quite clear on still ([](https://trello.com/c/eKdfrWkh/10-displaying-text-heavy-content-in-more-chunks-section-way-in-tiles))[https://trello.com/c/eKdfrWkh/10-displaying-text-heavy-content-in-more-chunks-section-way-in-tiles](https://trello.com/c/eKdfrWkh/10-displaying-text-heavy-content-in-more-chunks-section-way-in-tiles)). Somehow I am not sure which are the text heavy pages exactly and also I have made a two column layout for all the text heavy pages (this way they are more readable - text going trough the whole length of the screen is the most unreadable text, so I amended with two columns). I am not sure if I should be the one breaking a text apart and presenting it into a tiles, so this is something we would have to think about (what exactly we want and what is needed,...)

2) Big Ideas 

*    Focus for the Academy 
*    Academy -- Tie it to Gov 3.0. Designed for students, it’s Open. But others can participate. 
*   Online tools make it easier for student

3) Implementing 2.0 

*   Make it part of the University Program 
*   4 - 5 universities teaching Gov 3.0 
*   Pick the Knight Cities 

Connect with other students 

Mentorship Finder 

Project Showcase 

4) "Special Projects"  

Open Gov Stories 

*   Be Inspired 
*   Useful content 

David Halpern 

*

5) Channel Partners 

Note that there is still no way back to go to the main GovLab website (e.g. through footer logo or any other kind or pathway) - Can we have this link set up? thanks

[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWupOoIJf1EmVFXF4NyWBdlBnj2AnzUYdyBFj8V3NJo/edit?usp=sharing)https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWupOoIJf1EmVFXF4NyWBdlBnj2AnzUYdyBFj8V3NJo/edit?usp=sharing

Goals Nov/Dec - High Level

*   Academy 1.0

        *   Next steps:

                *   Email from Philipp to team (close out phase 1) - [Philipp Schmidt](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi)

                        *   Include next steps on videos, site dev, content dev, learning activities
            *   Milestones
            *   How are we executing going forward?

Launch plan

*   Build interest around pieces 

Question: Integrate Academy with GovLab?

*   Two brands: risk of brand confusion
*   Two sites: splits traffic and attention (and there isn't a huge amount)
*   Downside of integrating: Harder to recruit partners without them feeling they are being absorbed into GovLab (and branded as GovLab only)
*   Original framing -> "The Governance Lab (The GovLab) aims to improve people’s lives by changing how we govern. We are seeking new ways to solve public problems using advances in technology and science."

Academy 1.0

*   Bug fixes, Refinements
*   Set up mailing lists, respond to contact requests
*   Behavioral insights theme
*   History theme
*   Launch OpenGovStories
*   Run Unconference 
*   Nudge Unit Video & Course
*   Civic Tech U (maybe Academy 2)

Academy 2.0 (mentorship & collaboration)

Misc:

*   Launch plans
*   Integration with thegovlab.org

**Tickets / Web Site Feedback**

SOME POST LAUNCH REACTIONS (from GovLabbers): 

Add link to TheGovlab.org

**User interface: **

I just finished watching Beth's video on crowdsourcing and one thing that struck me was that it would be great if there were a separate link to all the videos so that rather than having to click back and watch Steve Koonin's video, I could watch it from the same page that I've just watched Beth's video. It'd be a similar interface to the New York Time's 'video' feed where you can watch all video content from one source: [](http://www.nytimes.com/video/)http://www.nytimes.com/video/

Perhaps tiles (in the same style as the 'Theme Topics' section) would be a dynamic way to display information for the text-heavy pages (i.e. the 'About' and the 'Get Involved' pages), which would reduce the need to scroll through the text. For example, the Media Lab's CoLab Radio uses photo tiles that include a headline and a link to read more about their particular projects: [](http://colabradio.mit.edu/)http://colabradio.mit.edu/, which I like. There are tiles elsewhere on the page, like in the 'Theme Topics' feature.

*   I just did a simple edit on the About page, to make it look better. 

It might be worth formatting the blog post titles in the blog RSS feed differently than the text below - somewhat difficult to read as is. 

Also might be worth having the search bar visible on every page instead of just the About page

Use column to break up data (i.e. on data heavy pages like the 'About' page)

Increase font size on 'About' page so that it's a little easier on the eyes.

Content:

Could be good to add contact information to the footer so that it appears on every page, e.g. our physical address, phone, email, and hyperlinks to our Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media profiles.

The Unhangout conference sounds like a great way for people in the field to meet one another. I see that it's in the banner on the main page, but it could also be helpful to have a list of upcoming events so that events like Unhangout are visible in multiple places.

(See also our calendar - [](http://thegovlab.org/events/))http://thegovlab.org/events/[)](http://thegovlab.org/events/)

Under the Add a Resource heading in the Get Involved section, it might be worth adding "To suggest more readings for our list, please email biblio@thegovlab.org

I would use the full open governance twitter list rather than the network of collaborators - more content from more people. 

Eventually a "Who we are" page that would include all GovLab partners 

The features on the homepage are lacking graphics?

[Old Tickets](/f9ASTZPFA8T#Old-Tickets)

New suggestions: 

*   [Erika Pogorelc](/ep/profile/oTNkHa0lFrI)Crowd page - can we make sure words don't get split in the quote (e.g. soc-iety) it is not brelink at soc-iety, but "read only society -(and then it breaks)"
*   [Cosmo Fujiyama](/ep/profile/FvW0oXx7eF3)Crowdsourcing expertise - Verhulst pt 2 video - text is too long and needs to be cut 
*   [Cosmo Fujiyama](/ep/profile/FvW0oXx7eF3)Big Data - No video for PEntland?
*   [Cosmo Fujiyama](/ep/profile/FvW0oXx7eF3) Linked Data - No video for Tim Berners Lee? 
*   [Cosmo Fujiyama](/ep/profile/FvW0oXx7eF3)Visualization - Deb Roy: text is too long and needs to be cut 
*   @Cosmo Visuzalization - Toolbox - can we have one liners next to the tools mentioned? (THIS APPLIES TO MOST OTHER TOOLBOXES AS WELL) 
*   [Cosmo Fujiyama](/ep/profile/FvW0oXx7eF3)Smart disclosure - main video? heading is not complete
*   [Erika Pogorelc](/ep/profile/oTNkHa0lFrI) double check what's going on with the code showing up at the bottom of the page - not sure what are we talking about(Erika)
*   **Updated it, but needs to be double-checked. **Update slider links (unhangout works, the others point to the image files). Can be done in Edit > Post and using the link field in sidebar. 
*   [Claudio Mendonca](/ep/profile/zeHT9ruLzZn) - Update the topic images with images consistent with the general branding (looks great Claudio) 
*   [Philipp Schmidt](/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi) - [Erika Pogorelc](/ep/profile/oTNkHa0lFrI) changed the **reply to text for comments**. Need to confirm that it's updating on production. (This ticket can be checked by anyone!) 
*   Nice to have - [Cosmo Fujiyama](/ep/profile/FvW0oXx7eF3) and All : Make the descriptons un-bolded (PS: Which descriptions?) I think I did most of them already.
*   [Cosmo Fujiyama](/ep/profile/FvW0oXx7eF3) - Under Data and its uses of governance: delete the word "even"; before the word open insert "big, personal and open data"
*   [Erika Pogorelc](/ep/profile/oTNkHa0lFrI)Titles (data/crowds/Data and its use for governance/Solving public problems with crowdsourcing) should have hyperlinks to thematic pages;
*   [Erika Pogorelc](/ep/profile/oTNkHa0lFrI) The Tim Burners Lee video for Linked Data (it is on toutube youtube) is not showing for some reason. Could you check?  It is actually a TED video. **CANNOT BE RESOLVED**: Only videos on youtube or vimeo will work. Got it. Thank you.
*   Nice to have - On the Theme homepages, can we change the placeholder topic graphics to video thumbnails as on the home page? Choose a thumbnail from any of the videos, taking some case to reflect some diversity in the choices. - Claudo redid this graphics now, they look nicer
*   Nice to have - FOOTER - Add a GovLab logo and hperlink back to www.thegovlab.org do we put any CC BY CA logo there as well? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CC BY CA? JUST THE LOGO + LINK TO THEGOVLAB.ORG WOULD BE AWESOME - 
*   [Erika Pogorelc](/ep/profile/oTNkHa0lFrI) - Email sign-up. We need at least a thank you confirmation (could be in the modal, or on an empty page). Right now it just dumps people on the Get Involved page, which is confusing.

*   Thumbnailsa, links to The Academy resources
*   Goal: 20 howcast videos

Shared interests:

Content  

Learning and community learning 

Short term - OGP, buidling a online learning community  

Longer term - Strategic, to think through seperately 

GovLab's strengths:

_ High quality resources and a network, we want to add social learning, mentorship and community.

 Media Lab x: 

_ 1 - 2  projects looks back at GovLab 

_ Beth can join in one of the sessions (Confirm the date) with Public Labs and Francois G  

_ To see which students are passionate 

_ Virtual Unconference, pulling together a event that is a part of the Academy, talking about the framing (building community, content, hands on? marketing, or developing plans?) 

_ Getting the event set up (we need hosts, putting up a sign up form, relatively easy to do, to do it for OGP, we are going to start through "this virtual unconference on open governnance," use this to bootstrap the event to build 2.0) 

Format 1: 

Here is why, here is what is working, mini-groups (30 minutes), closing, one hour.

Format 2: 

Working on projects together, to find a way to for teams, get mentors. 

Oct 18 - 19th 

** **

Website Feedback:

Static Place to get a lot of Content 

What is the next step, is there an ask, this is some free information 

We are a good vector for getting the stuff out (depending on the end user) 

Public Lab Website: focused on the individual who wants to build things

Toolkits, here is how we get individuals started with public science 

Needs a way for people to contribute and edit 

Entry point so people can learn

They just read, but they learn to do something 

Semi-independent module, give it rhythm, and give it a schedule, focuses the community a little bit, run them again, managing the community, all of this will take work  

Harder to get people to continuously interacting with each other 

**NOTES FROM BETH and PHILIPP Mtg (9/24):  **

1) We will work with his course to prototype version 2. That's slow but fun. Not good for our launch in October but fun stuff might come out of it and the collaboration will be promising. I offered to do a pitch session for an upcoming class and that we can provide research and content support for that they do.

2) For the Academy feature highlights, success stories, live events. Resources should become a tool set people can use to solve problems. So focus on success stories. 

3) Have people work on real challenges and real problems - start with problems defined by us. Later we can mentor them on their problems.

4) Unconference - face to face or virtual. Farming out google hangouts. Bring people into a virtual lobby to set the stage but then break people into 10 person micro-conferences. So imagine that you watch a video from OGP and then you qualify to join a hangout with that person.

5) Get ready for OGP to announce "something" that people can sign-up for (a course, an unconference, etc... ) Even if we only have a plan, a good landing page, and a sign-up form it seems too good an opportunity to miss. 

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION -- Updated Oct 14, 2013  (ALSO SENT VIA EMAIL on 10/14) 

**MISSION**: Funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and housed at New York University, the Open Gov Academy is a free, online community for those interested in teaching and learning how to work more collaboratively to solve public problems that improve people's lives. 

**APPROACH**: We strongly believe that engaged communities, coordinating and collaborating with government institutions and the media, are the most powerful drivers of effective and efficient change. Today most organizations, especially government, work behind closed doors. If we believe that working together in diverse groups we can tackle the problems we cannot solve alone, we have to learn new habits: how to work openly and participate effectively.  Whether members are committed to addressing climate change or domestic violence, science education in America or organic farming in India, Open Gov Academy is a place to acquire the mindset _and_ skillset for open and collaborative work. 

The Open Gov Academy provides an inter-disciplinary and collaborative approach to help future leaders gain a better understanding of new technology and scientific insight that make collaborative problem solving possible and acquire concrete skills to apply these lessons to real-life challenges. 

We train problem solvers to understand the effectiveness of these kinds of engaged, open, and participatory approaches through the following activities: 

·      Identifying and curating content that highlights engaged approaches to governance and other theories that attempt to explain how technology is changing democratic life and values in the form of learning modules;

·      Combining deep theory about participation and engagement by backing projects and providing mentorship. 

·      Helping members share their insights with the greater community, refine their approaches through collaboration, and build a field that can form the basis of a new discipline of training and inquiry.

**WHY IS THIS NEEDED?** Open Gov Academy is a one-stop hub to help users learn about the tools and technology to solve problems, make decisions more collaboratively and connect with mentors to help execute their ideas. The goal is to encourage more people to innovate and experiment with using new technology to solve public problems by providing them with useful learning materials and experienced mentors.

**AUDIENCE**: The Open Gov Academy targets the “purpose driven learner” – the person with a topic about which they are passionate – who wants to expand her toolkit for social change.  We train purpose driven leaders with new skills and a mindset of collaboration. We enable community members to connect, build and collaborate on solutions. We share training material, tools and content that helps users learn how to use openness to advance the cause learners care most about. 

**AUDIENCE PROFILES: ** 

·      For the Policy Entrepreneur: 

_“As <a policy entrepreneur>, I want to <learn basic tech skills, use the latest crowdsourcing opinions platform> so that I can < efficiently gather the opinions of my community on the design of latest public housing project>._

·      For the Graduate Student in Computer Science 

_“As <a graduate student in computer science>, I want to <learn about the broader policy context of the issue I care about > so that I can < apply my skills to make a difference in public problem solving, meet more people in the policy making field>_

·      For the Social Innovator in Business 

_“As <social innovator in business>, I want to <learn about the broader legal an economic context of open data> so that I can <develop a social business that leverages open data to make a difference and address a public need>._

**CONTENT: MODULES**

** **

We will launch the Open Gov Academy with two modules complete with reading lists, podcast listings, videos, hands-on learning experiences, and additional resources designed to help learners think creatively and concretely about the issues they care about most. The more we can demonstrate and capture the effective of these kinds of engaged, open and participatory approaches, the more we can create the capacity and the demand for engagement-based problem solving and governance. 

 The v.1 launch modules are: 

i.               Solving Public Problems with Crowdsourcing

_Crowdsourcing - using the "crowd" to contribute work, ideas, and expertise to government, business, or organizations - has proved to be a compelling concept with many variations. In this module, the Academy will cover the uses of crowdsourcing to gather expert advice, gather data and improve data quality, tap the public's skills and abilities, raise funds, and assess public opinion. _

_ _

The topics within “Solving Public Problems with Crowdsourcing” are: 

o   Crowdsourcing Expertise 

o   Crowdsourcing Data

o   Crowdsourcing Skill 

o   Crowdsourcing Funding

o   Crowdsourcing Opinion

ii.              Data and Its Uses for Governance 

_Module Description: Usable, meaningful data - both data from government to its citizens, and data that the public and experts provide to government - are core to making open governance work. The relationship of big data and open data, consumer-focused tools like personal data and smart disclosure, and technical approaches including linked data and data visualization, will all be covered by the Academy. _

** **

The topics within “Data and Its Uses for Governance” are: 

_ _

o   Open Data

o   Smart Disclosure

o   Linked Data and Semantic Web 

o   Data Visualization

o   Big Data

For each of the modules, we will feature the following products: 

o   READ

·      Curated reading lists for each topic (12 total in v.1) to provide introductory background material for those interested in learning about the topic. 

·      An open invitation to community members become contributors in the “Zotero Open Gov Community library” to recommend additional readings and provide annotated comments on the readings to facilitate discussion and feedback. The community creates a comprehensive library of substantive readings to help “make sense of the field.”

o   LISTEN

·      Curated podcast series for each topic (12 total in v.1) to provide a set of engaging material for those interested in listening to experts discuss specific success and learning stories. 

·      An open invitation to community member to record and contribute their own “citizen journalism” podcasts interviewing innovators talking about their experiences developing and implementing projects. These podcasts will be posted on the community forum for public view and comments.   

o   WATCH 

_·      How-Casts: Short (10 minute max) interviews with change agents describing a single open gov innovation and how they undertook it. Interviewees are asked to describe a project describing how they identified a specific problem to address, designed their program, implemented it, measured impact, and learned from the experience.  _

_·      Impact Stories: Mini Videos (2 - 3 minutes) that tell concise, compelling stories about open governance projects and their impact. While we are eager to hear about successful projects that impacted people’s lives as much learning is to be had from those that fell short._

·      _Intro Videos:_ These videos will offer introductions to the topic for institutional leaders intrigued about implementing governance innovations. The goal is provide specific and compelling segments of specific examples such that people want to read and teach themselves more. 

_·      Online viewers will be able to submit comments and questions, learn more about the subject area, and click on additional resources, links and tools to help them apply the lessons of each video to their own work._

o   HANDS-ON ACTIVITY

**CONTENT: OPEN GOV STORIES (v.1)**

** **

_Open Gov Stories captures the oral history of open government innovations around the world. We will set up a “recording booth” at the Open Government Partnerships Summit to capture the first set of 16 – 18 stories from Open Gov innovators. _

_ _

_Open Gov Stories records the faces and voices of innovators from government, civil society, the tech industry, the arts and academia talking about their work and how it impacts real people’s lives. Interviews convey their insights about how to implement innovations in open data, citizen engagement and collaborative democracy to the end of inspiring others undertake their own experiments. _

_We will produce two kinds of videos:_

_1) How-Casts: Short (10 minute max) interviews with change agents describing a single open gov innovation and how they undertook it. Interviewees are asked to describe a project describing how they identified a specific problem to address, designed their program,  implemented it, measured impact, and learned from the experience._

_2) Impact Stories: Mini Videos (2 - 3 minutes) that tell concise, compelling stories about open governance projects and their impact. While we are eager to hear about successful projects that impacted people’s lives as much learning is to be had from those that fell short._

_All interviews will be posted with a Creative Commons license and made freely available online via the GovLab Academy. _

_ _

_The main objective of the videos are to provide an interactive element: Online viewers will be able to submit comments and questions, learn more about the subject area, and click on additional resources, links and tools to help them apply the lessons of each video to their own work._

**Technical Info on Themes and Plugins**

Suggestion for Theme - [](http://themeshaper.com/thematic/)[http://themeshaper.com/thematic/](http://themeshaper.com/thematic/)

*   This is one of the best OpenSource Theme Frameworks I have ever worked with. These guys are a theme development team inside Automatic (The company behind Wordpress itself). They also have this other theme framework [](http://underscores.me/)[http://underscores.me/](http://underscores.me/), which I have never used. 

Viper Video Quick Tags - [](http://wordpress.org/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/)[http://wordpress.org/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/](http://wordpress.org/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/)

*   This is a very handy free plugin that I have used extensively before, and it saves a lot of work on both design and content uploading tasks. It will add a few buttons on the WYSIWYG editor in the WP Admin, replacing the process of copying and pasting embed codes. Click on the "Youtube" button, and paste the video URL. This way the videos will all be inserted with minimum work and avoiding messing up with html code, setting up width="1080", and stuff like that.
