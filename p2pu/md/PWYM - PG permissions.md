1. Loops and samples from a song or two from the _So_ album, similar to those that you've prepared for the Music Tiles app. Perhaps the samples from the various re/mixes of_Sledgehammer_? In our project, these samples would reside in a custom instance of the [Soundation.com](http://soundation.com/) DAW and be available to course participants during the course (Nov. 1 to Dec. 20). 

2. A set of mono multitrack stems (6-10 tracks) for one or two of Peter's songs. Ideally, the chosen song(s) would be the same as the one for which we have the loops for the Soundation project. The purpose of this project is to lead course participants in the process of creating a convergent mix matching a stereo recording using our custom #PWYM Mix tool, a demo of which you can view here using Google Chrome: [](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/)[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/).

[Alex's list of things]

**<u>For Round 1: (January 15, 2014 - March 15, 2014)</u>**

**Stems for _Sledgehammer_ **(provided to PWYM team as ten 48K 24 bit mono WAV files via [WeTransfer.com](http://wetransfer.com/) email on November 8, 2013 by Matt Glasbey)

*   Individual stems will be downsampled by PWYM team to mono 128K mp3 files and integrated into custom web-based mixing interface [PWYM Sledgehammer] to be h**osted on an NYU web serve**r - [](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/sledgehammer/)[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/sledgehammer/](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/sledgehammer/). [[accessible to anyone who has the link; not behind a password/login] [allows streaming; allows parameter changes to be shared; can't manipulate the stems; indiv experiences loading the stems in browser and manipulating the stems in browswer
*   Bradford Swanson (of the PWYM team) will create a stereo reference mix from the mp3 stems, which will be loaded into the custom web interface [PWYM Sledgehammer]. [avail to anyone the the link]
*   The participants in the course will mix the individual mp3 stems to approximate Brad's reference mix using only stem balance and pan controls. 
*   Participants will then share a URL with the mixing embedded static mix parameters via email and PWYM social media channels to listen to and critique each other's mixes. 
*   Participants will also create their own creative static mix and share that URL. At no time are the stem audio files **transmitted from user to user**. They are only transmitting mix parameters. All stems remain and stream to participants from an NYU server.
*   The PWYM Sledghammer interface will be available online to course participants throughout the duration of the course period (January 15, 2014 - March 15, 2014). [ie will take down in March]

_Part 2_

[soundation creates a custom version of their digital work - ie they will be able to remix the stems and export a WAV file to SoundCloud. [query whether SC would block - their DRM blocks stuff]

[we could control export functionality to prevent export of original stems]

[soundations own grouping/sound sharing could be used instead of soundcloud; could be used instead of soundcloud]; would allow more control but would negate (or at least limit) ability to share on G+

*   Individual stems (48K, 24-bit mono WAV files) will be downsampled by the the PWYM team to 44.1Khz, 16-bit mono WAV files. These files will be provided to [Soundation.com](http://soundation.com/) for integration into a custom instance of their Soundation Studio DAW for use by PWYM participants. For an example of what this will look like, see [](http://soundation.com/air_traffic)[http://soundation.com/air_traffic](http://soundation.com/air_traffic).
*   Soundation will develop a custom instance of their online DAW for Sledgehammer available at the following URL [not yet live]: [](http://soundation.com/sledgehammer/)[http://soundation.com/sledgehammer/](http://soundation.com/sledgehammer/). This remix project will only be online during the course period (January 15, 2014 - March 15, 2014). [
*   Participants will create an original mix and a creative remix of _Sledghammer_ in the [Soundation.com](http://soundation.com/) DAW and export and share a stereo WAV file of their mix and remix to the PWYM [SoundCloud.com](http://soundcloud.com/) community for feedback and peer comment: [](https://soundcloud.com/groups/play-with-your-music)[https://soundcloud.com/groups/play-with-your-music](https://soundcloud.com/groups/play-with-your-music). Note: [Soundcloud.com](http://soundcloud.com/) automatically downsamples streaming playback of these files to mp3 quality.

**Wet Stems for _In Your Eyes_ **(provided to PWYM team as eight 48K 24 bit mono WAV files via [WeTransfer.com](http://wetransfer.com/) email on November 8, 2013 by Matt Glasbey)

*   Individual stems will be downsampled by PWYM team to mono 128K mp3 files and integrated into custom web-based mixing interface [PWYM In Your Eyes] to be hosted on an NYU web server - [](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/inyoureyes/)[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/inyoureyes/](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/inyoureyes/).

**Loops for _Sledgehammer_ **(provided to PWYM team as eight 48K 24 bit mono WAV files via [WeTransfer.com](http://wetransfer.com/) email on November 12, 2013 by Matt Glasbey)

[soundation loads with the stems already in there - pre-curated by Peter's engineers for sampling and re-mixing.  Similar to those used in the Music Tiles App.]  

*   Individual samples (48K, 24-bit mono WAV files) will be downsampled by the the PWYM team to 44.1Khz, 16-bit mono WAV files. These files will be provided to [Soundation.com](http://soundation.com/) for integration into a library of remix samples within Soundation Studio DAW for use by PWYM participants. For an example of what this will look like, see [](http://soundation.com/air_traffic)[http://soundation.com/air_traffic](http://soundation.com/air_traffic).
*   These samples will be integrated into a  instance of their online DAW for _In Your Eyes_ available at the following URL [not yet live]: [](http://soundation.com/inyoureyes/)[http://soundation.com/inyoureyes/](http://soundation.com/inyoureyes/). This remix project will only be online during the course period (January 15, 2014 - March 15, 2014).
*   These samples will be used by participants as part of an original mix and a creative remix of _Sledghammer_ in the [Soundation.com](http://soundation.com/) DAW, where they will export and share a stereo WAV file of their mix and remix to the PWYM [SoundCloud.com](http://soundcloud.com/) community for feedback and peer comment: [](https://soundcloud.com/groups/play-with-your-music)[https://soundcloud.com/groups/play-with-your-music](https://soundcloud.com/groups/play-with-your-music). Note: [Soundcloud.com](http://soundcloud.com/) automatically downsamples streaming playback of these files to mp3 quality.

[Music Tiles does not result in publicly shared remixes; you can record your own remix in the app]

[Sledgehammer & In Your Eyes are available via PG's YouTube channel]

[weeks 1-4 is manipulating while maintaining integrity of original; adding effects, production stuff; weeks 5 - 6 is remix to create something new - using free samples provided by Soundation (tho could remix in anything you want if you have upgraded your Soundation.]

[don't want to lose the remixing part of things.  ]

[would be ok staying within Soundation]

[why use SoundCloud?  They co-promote.  They do some more stats and commenting stuff. Not sure what can be pulled from Soundation]

[another remix competition, by way of example of what we might do on Soundation: [](http://soundation.com/group/dariaremix)[http://soundation.com/group/dariaremix](http://soundation.com/group/dariaremix)]

[The PG stuff would be worked with in course from Jan 15, starting on PG content wk 3 (Feb 1 approx)

To date haven't provided access to the raw stem files; only streamable/manipulable within our custom tool or within Soundation.

**<u>For Round 2 and future rounds (Dates TBA)</u>**

We don't currently have a Round 2 scheduled for the PG content. However, if amenable, we'd like to be able to make our custom PWYM tools and the custom [Soundation.com](http://soundation.com/) environments available for our projects in the future. This could be negotiated/approved on a case-by-case basis.

**More points**

*   Soundation would love to be able to promote this and help drive people to our course. We should get permission and collaboration from PGs team on how they would like this to be marketed/branded.
*   We also need input from PGs team on how they would like the custom web-based remix tools - PWYM Sledgehammer and PWYM In Your Eyes to be branded.
*   We could eliminate the SoundCloud sharing aspect of the course and keep the sharing of files to just within the [Soundation.com](http://soundation.com/) community. As I mentioned before, Soundation could disable the "Save as WAV" function, which would prohibit users from exporting their mixes in any audio format. They would, instead, be able to save their mixes as a .sng file, which includes only mix automation and edit information. The way they could share their re/mixes with the PWYM community would be through Soundation's "Publish this Track" function, which shares a streaming copy of their mix within their own SoundCloud-like online community. We could ask Soundation to make this a private community, only open to verified PWYM participants, requiring a username/password login. Note: This might delay the start of our course, which is fine with me if that's what we need to do to satisfy PGs team.

From Rob Bozas 

_Hi Guys _

_Just getting in on this conversation. I understand that this is an educational project and you are using some supplied PG tracks. _

_Its very important for me to understand how you will be "releasing" the material as we have concerns over "parts" going into the public domain and also we need to make sure any permissions/ licenses we do give you do not conflict with our other record distribution and publishing deals._

_So please send me your rights requirements as soon as you can so we can clarify all the possible issues. _

_many thanks _

_Rob_

_Hi Alex (and team)_

_Just to make a full set I’m introducing Rob Bozas here who will work with me on licences.  Perhaps Philipp, Vanessa, and Carl you could help by giving us a description of the use and the rights you think you need?_

_With all best_

_Hi Richard,_

_Thank you for this quick reply and for your assistance. We're extremely appreciative for what we've already received from you and your team. We will arrange the course to match what we currently have in terms of PG assets. We look forward to sharing what we've prepared with you, your team and with Peter._

_Mike, I am CCing into the conversation Philipp, Vanessa, and Carl - all members of the P2PU team with whom I am collaborating on this project. They are the people on our team who will deal with the licensing and publishing clearances._

_Best wishes,_

_Dear Alex, _

_Sorry for this mail but its getting really hard to provide all that you need. _

_Its taking up a lot of our time that right now we just have. _

_We just don't have some of the things that you are asking for, these songs are from the analog time multi time where not much separation was thought of or was the time had for. _

_Also please understand that this has not been done before and therefore we need to be very carful with what does get out from Peter to the public as it is also a huge asset for us. _

_So right now we’re under a lot of pressure now, with our normal work,  trying to complete the mixes for Peter’s film of his tour and won’t be able to give this proper attention until early next year.  _

_In the meantime I’m introducing Mike Large who’s part of Peter’s Management Team and can deal with the appropriate licensing and publishing clearances. _

_Thank you Alex, i hope you understand. _
