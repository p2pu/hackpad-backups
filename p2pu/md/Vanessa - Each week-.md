# Vanessa / Each week:

*   _How is the world of VMG?_
*   _Status / Wins / Blocks or Progress / Priorities / Problems_

**Future Project Ideas**

**How to Be a Community Manager**

"Learn how to be a community manager. In community."

Problem Set:

*   Badges can succeed in domains that are being disrupted. 
*   Community managers do work that is often invisible. 
*   No one is focusing on badges that surface community / soft skills.

Solution Set:

*   In line with our strategic direction for social learning. 
*   Will recruit social learning people to our cause and build our reputation in this space. 
*   Make community manager skills visible, formalize the domain, and sketch out different takes on community.

Potential Partners:

*   Project could have a bevy of formal partners who all need community managers but have different "takes" on community: StackExchange, Mozilla, OKFN but also possibly for-profits (who do really interesting things in community mgmt space that we don't know about.)

Inspiration

*   UX school kickstarter campaign: [](http://unicorninstitute.com/)[http://unicorninstitute.com/](http://unicorninstitute.com/)

Next steps:

**Writing Project: Local Noir**

Problem Set: 

*   Cohorts: we've yet to give learners a compelling reason to build their own culture.
*   Learners in writing groups tend to want more feedback than give it to others.
*   Writing groups on the web are a nut that hasn't been cracked. Several paid sites offer guaranteed feedback. 

Solution Set:

*   Course framed as noir short-story writing with a local bent ie "Philly Noir, Brooklyn Noir"
*   "Cheating as learning"--if the small groups are more collaborative and inspired by each other, maybe they can nick ideas from reading each other's stories--and that's OK.
*   Pick real places and describe them--gives them a nice foundation that's easy to start with.
*   Potential final product could be an e-book?

P2PU angle:

*   what's diff to PWYM (why isn't this just another proof-of-concept for creative endeavours online) - in PWYM didn't give people enough to create their own culture.  
*   Is this going to teach us something useful? Nudge folks to meet face-to-face.
*   How will we run future courses now because of this? How will our community come to run their first course better?

Potential Partners:

*   Akashic Books: [](http://www.akashicbooks.com/subject/noir-series/)http://www.akashicbooks.com/subject/noir-series/
*   Narrative.ly: [](http://www.narrative.ly/unsolved-mysteries/)http://www.narrative.ly/unsolved-mysteries/
*   Thuglit: [](http://www.thuglit.com/)http://www.thuglit.com/

**Knight Foundation Project: Superheroes on the Web**

Problem Set:

*   At risk youth / disadvantaged youth struggle with "possible selves"--the ability to visualize their successful futures ([](http://www.education.com/reference/article/possible-selves-theory/))http://www.education.com/reference/article/possible-selves-theory/)
*   Knight Foundation smiles upon local, face-to-face communities using the arts, specifically helping young people become entrepreneurs.

Solution Set:

*   Inspirational superheroes and learning pathways can mediate poor self-concepts ([](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity_theory#Positive_distinctiveness))http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity_theory#Positive_distinctiveness)
*   Course would help learners create their own superhero web comics and build an audience for them on the web 
*   Helping learners build an audience online empowers them with entrepreneurial skills. [build an audience = build a network of peers = build engagement = build feedback loops = strengthen community = ]
*   Learners from Philly, Miami, Oakland could join and collaborate on visual storytelling and best practices to build an audience.

Inspiration & Potential Tools:

*   "Project Ideas" in Scratch forums: [](http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/9/)http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/9/
*   Patreon: learners build an audience as they grow, distribute what they create incrementally [](http://www.patreon.com/)http://www.patreon.com/

Potential Partners:

*   826 National (Dave Eggers Foundation) [](http://826national.org/)http://826national.org/
*   DC Comics (might contribute interviews with artists) [](http://www.dccomics.com/)http://www.dccomics.com/ 

        *   We have a contact with an editor there who is interested in helping out

*   Brooklyn Superhero Supply: [](http://www.superherosupplies.com/manuals-d7/)http://www.superherosupplies.com/manuals-d7/

Datapalooza (use of open data)

*   I don't really see the clear link here, but I know [Philipp Schmidt](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi) said they might be important partners. We could maybe talk about School of Data? But we didn't use government data...
*   Spread / highlight our reports and contributions to open data?
*   CR: think too about what your attendance will add to our community in short term; eg could be worth the cost of attendance if you did no more than write an inspirational blog post on your return, eg

        *   re-exhorting use of open data in p2p open education (and/or publishing open data, coz it is so useful for others in p2p open ed), 
    *   cross-linking to great examples of open data empowering learning in p2p projects
    *   advertising any upcoming school of data courses, open data publications, or oher upcoming P2PU open data activity
    *   start a conversation on thepeople
    *   anything else?

*   Good to let our community know these events are occuring and we're attending

        *   _"We would like to use the balance of the funds to develop 2 deliverables: create a “Lab Report” on our experiences with peer assessment and informal accreditation, and begin work to develop a kit on how to create a “School in a Box.” The “School in a Box” would chronicle how to craft participatory, project-based learning experiences, design peer assessments, and build sustainable learning communities."_

*   Timeline for School in a Box--connect with Jane? CR: Need a better idea internally of where this goes / what's feasible - eg who would we like to see roll it out in next 18mths, if we could give them a product to use?  Helps scope what we want to produce.
*   Timeline for Lab Report on Peer Assessment? 
*   [C](/ep/profile/mNzH4UoHZhs)[arl Ruppin](/ep/profile/mNzH4UoHZhs): Peer Assessment / Badges would be a different lab report than the "Assessment on the Web" project.

Knight Foundation Ideas

From Bekka: 

[Green: ](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:2141060535)

[This looks amazing. If it's not a nightmare to use, I think we should consider it for some of our publications, thank you for roadtesting it, VMG.](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:-1065668362)

CR: +1, tho TBD which publications this is appropriate for - what is significant enough to get this treatment and what is a 'normal' blogpost / webpage?

[Yellow:](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:378061350)

[Overall, I think there is a slight looseness to the piece - it feels, at some points, like a series of statements, which don't always hang together all that clearly, (unless this is for an audience who are more knowledgeable than average laypeople, in which case, ignore the following!). A bit more specificity would help to clarify eg:](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:-1739297156)

["As a learning community, P2PU is part of a larger ecosystem of online education with different trends, economic models..."  & ](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:-860251999)

[This sentence reads a bit oddly to me: ](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:1046597585)

*   ["The web has changed the way we learn. The way we recognize learning hasn’t." Does the hasn't refer to change or to the web? I think a subject might be missing.  ](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:545360454)

[ ](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:0)

 CR: looked at it on mobile - doesn't format perfectly (wordwrapping wrong --> text trimmed and impossible to view). minor point

 - Am assuming final version will link to other posts in the series / P2PU content ?  If branding/wrapping an issue, consider if this looks too much like a standalone publication rather than part of ongoing series on our website.. 

[Red:](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:2543081)

[Not much - I think this could go out as is, and it would be fine. ](https://p2pu.hackpad.com/uVvqpZSgzxt?src=email-line&eid=ymNsEM4UT6n#:-1699096343)

Meet w Carl

1.  website needs assessment
2.  resource hub 
3.  knowledge repository
4.  document with whatever functionality we need to have
5.  the structure for the site
6.  revisit strategy doc to see what the message and points of consensus are

**November 11, 2013**

**Progress:**

Assessment update: [](https://docs.google.com/a/p2pu.org/document/d/1t8EVyKjAWDMMxB0zf3LB4lQGEOtMqd91Xe0WMkhNtHo/edit)https://docs.google.com/a/p2pu.org/document/d/1t8EVyKjAWDMMxB0zf3LB4lQGEOtMqd91Xe0WMkhNtHo/edit

1.  2-3 sentences at the beginning: Learning and assessment the same-->wrong framing. Are they mixed in with each other/mashed up
2.  1 or 2 more examples that tie it closer to a university/what they would think about--examples are very webbbbby

        1.  2-3 academics--does this sound like part of your world/could you make this step?
    2.  Send to Karen Fasimpaur, Natalie Rusk

Emerging Themes We Like

1.  Opportunities/look forward-->tools will be relevant for assessment
2.  Identity fraud--a lot of people are concerned about that-->but we're not excited about it. (we don't really care about cheating)
3.  Google helpouts
4.  Identities--there are new ways of pulling together accomplishments online. and it's going to get easier (linkedin/badges)--showcase the things that you care about in a curated way
5.  Analytics--soundcloud groups, emerging sense of quality (but balance & make sure that the right thing should be measured)

*   Music MOOC: continue with community mgmt, weekly newsletter monday with spotlight on learners
*   Writing MOOC--thoughts on this?
*   Connect with Carolina (was in hospital for our meeting)

Edit: look at it from an outsider's perspective--what would make it cool?

- individual goal setting

- connect to a local place/local community

**October 24**

Progress

*   Data Explorer Mission Complete
*   Music MOOC production and hustling

Priorities

*   Music MOOC?

        *   Content review
    *   Continue with outreach
    *   Bagel push

                *   Producer ask: We're close here, we want to promote it and announce it--we'd like to know when we'll get the materials
        *   Parallel ask: we go back through Annie and we ask for the live Q&A about his methods at the end of the class you get this chance to have a live Q&A with Peter Gabriel

*   Data Explorer report (how)

        *   Online workshop over 2 days and using hangouts
    *   Here's the tool we used, here's how we set it up
    *   Red / Yellow / Green from each 

Topics:

*   Strategy and Org Stuff
*   Operations 

DATA EXPLORER

Greens:

The trainings & tracks. They were interesting and useful.

Group projects where people could break off a piece and do it together. Track 3 did this well: [](https://trello.com/b/G0NNzqCx/bangladesh-garment-industry-database-and-mapping)[https://trello.com/b/G0NNzqCx/bangladesh-garment-industry-database-and-mapping](https://trello.com/b/G0NNzqCx/bangladesh-garment-industry-database-and-mapping)

Recruiting trainers and having meetings together beforehand. These were great, and I plan to implement in the future.

Unhangout (PS: Do you mena the "Lobby"?) as a mission control. The tracks and participants in them were clear and easy to use.

Facilitation. These folks were great, supportive, took interest in people's projects.

Yellow:

The difference between Hangout on Air and using Unhangout as a way to simply organize synch hangouts was unclear.

Diversity. The audience was pretty much NGO/data folks who already knew what to do with data. They were helpful to n00bies, but it was difficult to work on the bigger projects without presupposed knowledge.

Red:

Attendance, it's true. There were more facilitators than outsiders/new to data. Perhaps because the ask was "get involved with a problem" as opposed to "Learn data wrangling in the service of solving a problem."

To me, the subject matter didn't seem alive/I wasn't called to action by it. I did my own little visualization, which was neat, but my recommendation would be to showcase "here are the things you can do with a little data knowledge" and then have folks find data they find compelling. OKFN/School of Data is generally more committed to the cause of open data than educational methods surrounding it, but that's my .02.

Is he hanging over material to a company that could commerically use the materials--but if it's completely open that w/b ok (we think)

Writing

Reach out to Karen/Nanowrimo (peer feedback and small critique groups) & Jim Groom

Different configurations about what the writing mooc could look like

DML Narrative

Fill in field with budget narrative

Put a sentence in there that's a little more concrete

Priorities

*   Assessment: next steps?

vmg to make first draft of principles

*   Data Explorer: meeting tomorrow to establish splash page, firm dates (Attn: Drew's wedding!), content development, sign up survey

vmg find out when this is

*   Webcraft: meeting next week. Mark?
*   MRI research: literature done for June (but need to check in with him) meeting with Thieme tomorrow 
*   Badges: synced with Erika on user testing improvements, need to pop those into the Trello today
*   Badge future

1.  Framework around OER--->Badges might be recognition of activity
2.  Open and participatory future--->making projects/evolution of projects would still be relevant
3.  Real alternative--->puts Badges in the realm of accreditiation. Could pilot 3 folks and follow their stories. Would mesh well with the initiative to make Badges count. Offer learning paths through badges. But is this tired / do we believe in it? How can we frame Badges as enablers of academic mindsets with successful (like, real-world successful) results?

vmg to read the document and leave comments 

Problems: 

*   iPad only until Sep 15. The only thing I can't do is make slides :(  Everything is backed up in Dropbox. Trello, chat, hangout and hipchat are all running and work--need to buy a  keypad and stand but I think I will be ok

**August 13**

        *   Demo of Youth Voices / How badges can be used with learners

*   Take a tour mockup

        *   What are cards?
    *   <s>Instead: VMG revises the copy for the homepage mockups</s>

*   School of Webcraft--still working on this

        *   VMG is not selling this--not pushing any of these
    *   Spinning it off into our own thing--this was built for a very specific set of challenges--now we are limited into how we can visually convey them--would make sense to make it its own thing so its stronger visually
    *   Stronger visual identity--more in line with the Mozilla branding

*   VMG's Review-did hers

        *   Feedback

*   Research proposals: on to the next step: W00t

<u>Priorities</u>

*   P2PU Meetings Boston
*   Data MOOC Project Plan
*   Final DML report (due Friday)
*   School of Webcraft plan revised
*   Blog post: 66 Badges in 30 Days (July 31 or August 1)

(Lower priority): Research project plan & posting of research proposals on discourse

*   Instead: VMG revises the copy for the homepage mockups
