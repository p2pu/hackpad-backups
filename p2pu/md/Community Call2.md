**Problems**

**Process**

**Agenda for discussion:**

*   Consulting criteria - CR drafting; will circulate for comment later today

        *   looking to generate a simple framework for generating yes/no answers on jobs that come up. 
    *   CR working on basic roadmap (not blueprint) with as few criteria as possible. 

*   Questions for Data visualisation (via this thread: [](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/visualization-of-p2pu-courses/281/4))http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/visualization-of-p2pu-courses/281/4)

        *   my question: can we have more :-)
    *   it would be interesting to see engaged users in a viz like that
    *   can we add thematic colours (grouping courses by type)
    *   And looking at courses where P2PU has been the most involved in the creation. 
    *   Data visualization tells a story from a very high level, which is useful in reflection and conveying a sense of connectivity
    *   [Vanessa Gennarelli](/ep/profile/ufOl3tEe6YY) checks in and what are you doing next, and oh, we have an idea or two :)

*   Music MOOC

        *   VMG and team have been doing weekly roundups of what has been happening 
    *   These will be forwarded to discourse / hackpad / other places.

*   Community Management/Learning Lead Roles

        *   Proposed: Learning Lead (in strategy doc)

                *   Project management: liaison with partnerships, make sure projects get the resources they need, everyone has goals and next steps, establish workflow.
        *   Educational content development: develop learning goals, feedback and suggestions on videos, emails, exercises, activities. 
        *   Reporting to the wider educational landscape for projects I manage: report on learning design, learning goals, outcomes and applications to the larger education landscape
        *   Research: recruit and work with researchers, analyze data
        *   Human face of the organization to learners: know community members on a first-name, human basis and know when community members should be connected to each other.
        *   Product feedback--insight into how the community uses the product.
        *   Harvesting stories--bringing them to the wider organization.

*   PR Strategy (carried over from last week):

        *   Format

                *   Longer-form blog posts
        *   Reaching outside the ed world
        *   Nurturing relationships with bloggers and reporters in wider culture (awl, fastcompany, wired, boingboing)

        *   Overarching plan--when do we report and how?

*   TEDx talk

**Report on OER university launch Nov. 1**: 

This project is gaining currency in many universities around the world. How can we best engage, to be sure appropriate synergies with P2PU, open badges, etc. are injected into the model? (Instructors and administrators at the meeting were very interested, but lacked knowledge of, informal education, badgesâ€¦) See here: [](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40460)http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40460
