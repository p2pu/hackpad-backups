</li>
<li>Peer activity in skype--3/4 students and have face-to-face sessions in groups (starting every other week and then once a month)</li>
<li>Group assessments --&gt; take a look at their progress as a group / eliminate two basic problems (capacity of classrooms and dealing with different levels in the same class)</li>

<li>Is there a cohort of students for next spring ---&gt; or next fall</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Library as infrastructure--&gt;digital literacy course + framework<ul><li>optional meetups for Instituto students / dedicated time to work on online courses</li>

<h2>September </h2><p>Attendees:</p><ul><li><a href='/ep/profile/Dc7zU8svumi'/>Philipp Schmidt</a></li>

<p>Agenda</p><ul><li>Background Chicago Public Library / Knight</li>
<li>Background P2PU</li>
<li>Ideas</li>
<li>Grant specifics / deliverables</li></ul>

<p>Knight Application:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>From September 10 to September 30, weâ€™re inviting you to submit your idea to win a share of $2.5 million</li>
<li>Award in January of 2015</li>
<li>After submissions close, participants will have the opportunity to refine their submission during the feedback and refinement phases.</li></ul>

<p>Idea: Peer support of adults taking an online course together</p><ul><li>CPL: trying to figure out adult learning--&gt;something that will help them in their careers</li>
<li>Tried acting like a coworking space--shared workspace in a library, but couldn&rsquo;t make it fit. coworking for people looking for jobs didn&rsquo;t fully make sense.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Feels like the right role for libraries, but a role that nobody has figured out how to do</li>
<li>Career coaching services needed--&gt;refer and introduce people&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul><li>Libraries can provide an information-rich/ knowledge-rich environment for people who are taking online courses<ul><li>Add a level of support and scaffolding that does not exist online</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Andrea: The idea of learning all by myself in front of a computer screen isn&rsquo;t so compelling</li>
<li>Framing the opportunity/ need:<ul><li>Could tie to retention, which is an issue especially for those not already succeeding in education (MOOC &quot;survivors&quot; tend to have advanced degrees, not enough diversity)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Subject: unclear--&gt;what are the courses that people want to take in library settings</li>
<li>Library successfully support online learning? Figure out what they are already doing online? Then being a connector bw libraries and online learning</li>
<li>Surveys and question-asking about what they want to learn</li></ul>

<p>What&rsquo;s needed?</p><ul><li>Space (many organizations already use the library without the library involving them)</li>
<li>Support?</li></ul>

<p>Who would we target?</p><ul><li>Can we find users both in the existing community of the library, as well as the communities in online courses?&nbsp;<ul><li>Promote to library users (posters / fliers)<ul><li>Meetup site</li>
<li>Library home page</li>
<li>Chicago Hive network</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Promote to edX users (need to confirm that&rsquo;s possible)</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>People already using library?</p><p>expanding user base?</p><p></p><p>Format?</p><ul><li>We could design a &rsquo;course&rsquo; like the rhizomatic learning course where everyone takes a course that interests them and our &rsquo;course&rsquo; is a framework around meet-ups, maybe &rsquo;how-to&rsquo; get the most out of MOOCs etc</li>
<li>Or like Philipp&rsquo;s State Dept solution - we curate a shortlist of interesting courses - group decides what they want to do, we provide support piece: Conversation recipes and scripts--that group gets a little bit of support</li>
<li>A way to promote the library through an online course</li></ul>

<p>Homework:</p><ul><li>Who are library users interested in online courses?</li>
<li>What courses are they interested in?</li>
<li>What do they need to be (more) successful?&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Host a regular meetup</p><ul><li>Space - Reconfigure existing meeting spaces for peer-learning&nbsp;</li>
<li>Calendar - Sign-up, keep track of who is coming, etc.</li></ul>
<p>Human facilitators/ Support:</p><ul><li>Social/ study habits</li>
<li>Content - Academic support--librarian could pull ressources</li>
<li>Technology (how to use the online course) - Librarian could support with digital literacy interventions</li>
<li>Introduce folks to online learning--people who don&rsquo;t know about online learning in the first place<ul><li>Low hanging fruit--people who are already taking online courses</li>
<li>Further along--people who have *never* taken online courses (appeal to those) in the future, this will increase access to online learning in general</li>
<li>Sketch out how we might use the library space in the future--&gt;innovate on the space as well</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Tie it to retention in these online communities</li>
<li>Promote</li></ul>
