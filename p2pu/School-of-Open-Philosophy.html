<body><h1>School of Open Philosophy</h1><p><b>Purpose</b></p><p></p><p>The&nbsp; problem: Open content, tools and processes can vastly improve access to&nbsp; and participation in research, education, technology, and culture, but&nbsp; not enough people know what &quot;open&quot; means or how it applies to their&nbsp; lives.</p><p></p><p>The solution: Peer learning on what &quot;open&quot; means and how&nbsp; to use open content, tools, and processes powered by peer mentors and&nbsp; learners, self-organized into courses which themselves leverage existing&nbsp; &quot;open&quot; learning materials.</p><p></p><p>The goal: Encourage everyone,&nbsp; including artists, educators, learners, and researchers, to improve&nbsp; their fields through the use of open content, tools, and processes.&nbsp; Provide opportunities to obtain skills and certification around open&nbsp; practices that result in improved access to and participation in&nbsp; research, education, technology and culture.</p><p></p><p><b>Scope</b></p><p></p><p>Learning&nbsp; opportunities and certification that focus on promoting open practices&nbsp; of all kinds, especially in research, education, and culture. Open&nbsp; practices include using the content, tools and processes shared with us,&nbsp; enabling others to use, share and adapt what we create, and supporting&nbsp; transparency in our content, tools and processes. If a course involves&nbsp; teaching or learning about any of these practices, either broadly or in a&nbsp; particular field, then it probably fits in the School of Open.</p><p></p><p>Courses&nbsp; must be built around tools that are accessible to any learner free of&nbsp; cost, free to share, and free to modify to suit their needs.&nbsp; Participants should also be encouraged to openly share their work.&nbsp; Participants are expected to openly license their work under the CC&nbsp; Attribution-ShareAlike, or compatible license, so that they may review,&nbsp; revise, and adapt each others work.</p><p></p><p><b>Values</b></p><p></p><p>As&nbsp; part of P2PU, the School of Open runs on the same values and principles&nbsp; that make up the foundation of P2PU: openness, community, peer&nbsp; learning.&nbsp; We are articulating these values in order to guide our&nbsp; actions, but&nbsp; P2PU has always been about doing, and our actions will in&nbsp; turn help us probe and refine these values.</p><p></p><p><b>P2PU is open</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Open sharing and collaboration enable&nbsp; participation, innovation, and&nbsp; accountability. Our community is open so&nbsp; that everyone can&nbsp; participate.&nbsp; Our content is open so that everyone can&nbsp; use it. Our&nbsp; model and&nbsp; technology are open to enable experimentation and&nbsp; ongoing&nbsp; improvement.&nbsp; And our processes are open so that we are accountable to&nbsp; our community.</p><p></p><p><b>P2PU is a community</b>:&nbsp; P2PU is a&nbsp; community-centric&nbsp; project and our governance model reflects&nbsp; that. P2PU&nbsp; is driven by&nbsp; volunteers, who are involved in all aspects of&nbsp; the&nbsp; project. As members&nbsp; of this community, we speak and act with&nbsp; civility,&nbsp; tolerance, and&nbsp; respect for other opinions, people, and&nbsp; perspectives.&nbsp; We strive for&nbsp; quality as a community driven process of&nbsp; review,&nbsp; feedback and revision. ?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>P2PU is passionate about peer learning</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp; P2PU is&nbsp; teaching and learning by peers for peers. Everyone has&nbsp;&nbsp; something to&nbsp; contribute and everyone has something to learn. We are&nbsp; all&nbsp; teachers and&nbsp; we are all learners. We take responsibility for our&nbsp; own&nbsp; and each others&nbsp; learning.</p><p></p><p><b>Get Involved.</b></p><ul><li><a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/get-involved/"></a>http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/get-involved/</li></ul>

<p></p><h2>FEEDBACK</h2><p></p><ul><li>John&nbsp; Weitzmann, CC Germany Legal: To my impression, the philosophy should&nbsp; not only rest on the 2 mission parts &quot;tell what open means&quot; and &quot;teach&nbsp; how to do that&quot;, but also rest on part 3 &quot;show why open is better when&nbsp; and for whom&quot;. From years of experience around &quot;open everything&quot; I&rsquo;d say&nbsp; that promoting open is not so much about telling people how to do it,&nbsp; but to tell them why to do it. Once they understand the Why they tend to&nbsp; find pleasure in teaching themselves the How. This is not about&nbsp; convincing by being evangelic or ideological about open, but rather&nbsp; about giving good S forS why open is different, where it improves what&nbsp; and how that relates to almost everybody&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li>Markus Deimann:&nbsp; I could not agree more with John. It is very important to highlight&nbsp; that the commitment to openness also implies a moral value which is to&nbsp; promote the &quot;true&quot; spirit of it and prevent all forms of&nbsp; instrumentalisations. In the current process of commodification of&nbsp; education is a great danger of loosing and neglecting the spirit of&nbsp; openness. It can also be argued that once you opt for openness you also&nbsp; take responsibility to promote it.&nbsp;</li>
